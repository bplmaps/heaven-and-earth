The most striking, and unusual, feature of the maps and charts is the blue color. It sets them apart from other Chinese maps, and indeed maps from any other part of the world, produced at the time. Scientific spectral analysis, first done at the Weissman Preservation Center at Harvard University, has confirmed the pigment to be Prussian Blue. 

Prussian blue, a ferric (iron) hexacyanoferrate, was first synthesized accidentally in Berlin by Johann Jacob Diesbach, a Swiss painter and colormaker, in 1706. Its production is a complex and time-consuming process of acidic additives into a crystalline distillation with resulting varying sized crystals that can be filtered to create different tones of blue (note the two tones of blue used on the terrestrial map). 

The blue maps and charts were produced around the time when Chinese manufacturers learned to make the pigment locally and were less dependent on European imports. The discovery of the use of Prussian blue in the case of the blue maps and charts is historically significant as it demonstrates the first large-scale use of Prussian blue for printing in China, and East Asia, in the first decades of the nineteenth century.
