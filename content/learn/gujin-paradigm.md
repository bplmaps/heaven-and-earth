Ma Junliang’s Capital Edition of the complete map (based on) astronomy, of circa 1795, presents visually the Chinese concept of gujin 古今. Gujin means something like “past and present.” The character gu means an unspecified there-then and jin means the here-now. The two terms knit together—gujin—suggest a conversation between temporalities, whereby Chinese scholars actively joined historical events of the past to help define the present moment through a process of deliberate recovery and application. Conceptually the gujin paradigm is also found in the blue maps and charts that specifically model and reference the 1247 map and chart to define the moment of their creation.
