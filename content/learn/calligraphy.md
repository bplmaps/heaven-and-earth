The blue star chart presents three different types of calligraphy. The first (far right) sheet presents the eight-character title in seal script (zhuanshu 篆書), the last (far left) sheet presents an epilogue, a date and a signature of the maker in clerical script (lishu 隸書), while the remaining six sheets present celestial information using standard script (kaishu 楷書). That a single object presents three distinctive styles of calligraphy is highly unusual in Chinese visual arts.

The final sheet of the 1826 star chart is signed by Qian Yong (1759–1844), a poet and author. Qian was as an accomplished calligrapher and collector of rubbing of the so-called stone stele (bei 碑) school of calligraphy, traveling extensively around China collecting samples of rubbings from stele. That the celestial chart was designed with multiple styles of calligraphy suggests a calligrapher, like Qian Yong, designed the text layout. Also, that the production of all the maps and charts are done in the manner of rubbings suggests a collector of rubbings. And finally, that the two stele that the blue map and chart are modeled after were, and still are, found in the city of Suzhou and the blue maps and charts were all produced in the city of Suzhou suggests that Qian Yong participated in all phases of production.
