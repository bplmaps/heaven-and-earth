Correlative properties on the blue chart and the tianwen tu can be found on the outer ring (horizon). It is read counterclockwise and indicates numerous directional signifiers such as the widths of the twenty-eight lunar mansions (the constellations that the moon “appears in” over the course of its cycle), the twelve terrestrial branches (chen 辰), twelve Jupiter stations or zodiacal positions (muxingci  木星次), names of the ancient states (fen 分) and ancient divisions (ye 野) of China “governed” by that group of stars. For example, the “first” section reads “zi (at the bottom of the blue chart, offset right and the top of the tianwen tu, offset left) is in the yuanxiao position (ci), ancient state (fen) of Qi, Qingzhou division (ye, today’s Shandong province).”

There is an accepted and understood relational co-existence and correlation between events observed in the sky and events on earth, a type of astrological consideration found in many cultures from ancient times until today. The example above confirms that conceptually there is a direct correlation between the celestial and terrestrial realms with spatial coordinates for both presented side by side in the same pie-section division.
