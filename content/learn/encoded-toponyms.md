A particular characteristic of the Chinese typology of administrative map first introduced by Luo Hongxianâ€™s (1504-64) in his Enlarged Territorial Atlas (Guangyu tu) of the mid sixteenth century, was toponyms that were encoded to reflect the humanity (administrative bodies like prefectures, sub-prefectures, counties, and so forth) of all places in the empire operating within a Chinese familial framework.

Administrative unit types, identified in a key, linked geometric shapes to toponyms, visually linking places with the people of those places. This encoding visually prioritizes administration over territory, the people living in each administrative unit become more important than scale or geometry, as does the relational spacing of each toponym with the surrounding ones in an administrative hierarchy of the entire empire.
