The blue terrestrial map and two other maps in this exhibition specifically cite the work of the Huang family of Qing court cartographers as models for their maps. The Huang family lineage began with Huang Zongxi (1610-95) and his 1673 Complete Map of China (Yudi quantu), a map modeled from Luo Hongxian’s 1555 Complete Terrestrial Map (Yudi zongtu). Huang’s map was amended and updated by his grandson Huang Qianren (1694–1771) as a multi-colored woodblock-printed map in 1767 with the title All under heaven map of the everlasting unified Qing empire (Daqing wannian yitong tianxia quantu).  It is the 1767 map that is referenced for all three maps.
