The epilogue of the 1822 edition of the blue celestial chart specifically references Huang Shang’s  dili tu and tianwen tu. Huang’s two maps were meant to be combined to present ideal models for the young Prince Jia, the future Ningzong Emperor (r. 1194-1224) on good governance. The map displays a unified China before the creation of the Southern Song dynasty (1127-1279), a period before the Song imperial family lost north China to the Jurchen-led Jin Dynasty (1115-1234), as an aspiration to return to the earlier idealized time of the Northern Song dynasty. When combined with the star chart, the viewer was meant to visualize that good governance through the correlative properties between heaven and earth found on the micro scale within both the map and chart and on the macro scale in consideration of the entire empire. Huang’s map and chart were a deliberate piece of statecraft meant to serve as a moralistic exemplar for the young Ningzong emperor.

Over 500 years after the creation of Huang’s map and chart, Chinese scholars in the city of Suzhou decided to create their own, albeit in blue, updated images of heaven and earth. As a result, the subtle and covert political implications found in the combined 1190s map and chart presented by ethnically Han officials longing for an earlier (and thus idealized) Han Chinese based political structure are reactivated (in a gujin paradigm), in an equally subtle and covert manner, through the blue maps and charts during the early nineteenth century by ethnically Han scholars in Suzhou (not the capital of Beijing) longing for a time and political structure from before Manchu rule.
