Two schools of collecting and related collecting practices originated in seventeenth century China amongst groups of scholars, artists, collectors, and calligraphers that formed specialized social groups. The first group collected, made rubbings and copied calligraphy found on ancient stone stele (bei 碑), while the second group did the same for calligraphy found on ancient bronze vessels or from copy books of calligraphy (tie 帖). Both types of scholarly groups were in a period of revival in the early nineteenth century and Qian Yong (one confirmed author of the blue charts) was likely active in such groups which contributed to using the rubbing production method for the blue maps and charts.
