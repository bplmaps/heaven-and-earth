The blue maps and charts follow closely the aesthetics of a print production method known as a rubbing. To make a rubbing from an engraved stone stele, slightly moistened paper would be fixed on a prepared, flattened smooth then carved, stone. The moist paper would be manipulated using brushes and pointed sticks, pressing the paper into the recessed areas of the carved stone. An inked (typically in black) dauber (fabric over cotton wadding) would be tamped down onto the paper-covered stone. The ink would adhere to the “raised” paper making the areas of carved away stone appear in white. In this process a positive image is carved on the stone, and a positive image is created on the inked paper. The “rubbings” that are the blue maps and charts were however made using woodblocks. They contrast to the typical manner of woodblock printing where a negative image is carved into the block, the block is then inked and the paper pressed onto the inked block with the ink transferring to the paper, making for a positive image on the paper. Printing using the rubbing method is comparatively very labor intensive and time consuming, creating essentially a unique print each time. Historically in China, it is highly unusual to print a rubbing from woodblocks, creating a positive image from a positive block, especially at the scale of the blue maps and charts.
