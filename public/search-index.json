[{"content":"<p>During the first decades of the nineteenth century, China was in a moment of transition, grappling with its geopolitical status as both an ancient and modern nation-state. The power of the Qing dynasty had just reached its zenith, establishing a vast territory of political and cultural influence over a multiethnic, geographically dispersed population. Chinese scholars and artists were reconsidering the ideological and practical significance of the imperial realm. Meanwhile, European ideas and goods were arriving in China, bringing both new opportunities and challenges.</p>\n<p>It was in this moment that two series of large-format maps, one terrestrial and one celestial, were printed in the city of Suzhou. These maps were presented in an extraordinary format, on eight vertical sheets printed in the style of rubbings. Even more strikingly, they were rendered in a rich blue coloring. The pigment Prussian blue had recently begun to be produced in China, and these maps were amongst the first printed objects in East Asia to make use of the colorant—predating the famous use of Prussian blue by Japanese print artists soon after.</p>\n<p>The blue maps were more than just visually astonishing. They also captured Chinese ideas about the relationship between terrestrial and celestial space, and still provide insight today into how Chinese scholars and artists conceptualized the world around them. Beautiful and powerful in equal measure, these blue maps capture details of a transitional moment in the history of China—and the wider world. This exhibition considers these two maps in the context of their production, consumption, and functionality, revealing them as unique objects in the global history of mapmaking.</p>\n","length":262,"title":"Cover","type":"cover","url":"http://localhost:8080/"},{"content":"","length":0,"title":"Contents","type":"table-of-contents","url":"http://localhost:8080/contents/"},{"content":"<p>Welcome to this lovely exhibition</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"gnelson"}],"length":5,"subtitle":"Cosmographic Spaces","title":"Introduction","type":"splash","url":"http://localhost:8080/intro/"},{"abstract":"TKTK Abstract\n","content":"<p>In China, during the early decades of the nineteenth century, two series of large format maps, one terrestrial and one celestial, were printed between 1812 and 1826 in the city of Suzhou, one of the economic and intellectual centers of the Chinese empire at the time and throughout much of China’s imperial history. The terrestrial maps, of which most of the ten editions are entitled <em>Geographical</em> <em>Complete Map of the Everlasting Unified Qing Empire</em> (<em>Daqing wannian yitong dili quantu</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">大清萬年一統地理全圖</span>), present the realm of the Qing Empire (1644–1911) and selected surrounding regions. The four extant editions of the celestial maps entitled <em>Complete Map of Unified Star Configurations in the Heavens</em> (<em>Huntian yitong xingxiang quantu</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">渾天壹統星象全圖</span>), dated to 1822 and 1826, present a planisphere of all the known stars and extensive descriptions of known celestial bodies and their related celestial mechanics. This catalogue essay considers these two maps in the contexts of their interconnected “4 M’s;” that is methods, materials, makers and models; while the catalogue entries provide information about the content of each of the maps and charts included in the exhibition.</p>\n<h2>Methods and Materials</h2>\n<p>The methods and materials for the production and consumption of the blue maps and charts are unique in cartographic history, not only locally in East Asia but within the larger world.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> Both maps and charts were produced on eight sheets of Chinese <em>xuan</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">宣</span> paper in three unique manners; the paper, the printing method and the blue colorant. While the associated mounting and consumption practices are also unique.</p>\n<p>Xuan paper, made primarily in Anhui and Zhejiang provinces, was principally blue sandalwood (Tara Wingceltis, L. <em>Ulmus Cavaleriei</em>, C. <em>qingdan</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">青檀</span>), a deciduous tree found throughout China, mixed with differing degrees of rice plant fibers. In the case of the blue maps and charts, a low grade <em>xuan</em> type paper was used, one with less blue sandalwood fibers and more rice plant fiber fill. The paper used was unusual, between a low-cost bamboo paper typical of rubbings (a printing technique) and a high-cost sandalwood paper typical of painting and calligraphy.</p>\n<p>The blue maps follow closely the aesthetics of a print production known as a rubbing. This printing production methodology began in the Tang dynasty (618-907 CE). The manner of presentation of white characters on a solid color, here blue, should be understood within the context of historical Chinese practices associated with making rubbings from stone stele and ancient bronzes. In China, rubbings were an essential component of long-established epigraphic study and associated collecting practices, as well as specific calligraphic practices. To make a rubbing from an engraved stone stele, slightly moistened paper would be fixed on a prepared, flattened smooth then carved, stone. The moist paper would be manipulated using brushes and pointed sticks, pressing the paper into the recessed areas of the carved stone. An inked (typically in black) dauber (fabric over cotton wadding) would be tamped down onto the paper-covered stone. The ink would adhere to the “raised” paper making the areas of carved away stone appear in white. In this process a positive image is carved on the stone, and a positive image is created on the inked paper. This contrasts to the typical manner of woodblock printing where a negative image is carved into the block, the block is then inked and the paper pressed onto the inked block with the ink transferring to the paper, making for a positive image on the paper. In other words, typical woodblock printing creates a positive image from a negative block.</p>\n<p>The blue maps and charts production adhere this process of making rubbings from stone steles, but through printing from woodblocks instead of stone. Like a stone stele, a positive image would be carved into a wooden block that was then used to print in the manner of a rubbing. Historically in China, it is highly unusual to print from woodblocks a positive image from a positive block, especially at this scale. Woodblock printing typically was used to create more easily and quickly multiple similar copies of any given work. Printing in the manner of a rubbing is comparatively very labor intensive and time consuming, creating essentially a unique print each time. Through close visual analysis of the printed paper, the rubbing method of production using woodblocks can easily be seen on the blue maps and charts. As already noted, during the printing process the moistened paper was pressed and stretched into the negative space of the carved woodblock, furthest for the large characters of the title. After printing, when the finished print was to be mounted, the paper was pressed flat and glued to an additional paper backing. The resulting “stretch marks,” formed during the printing process, became folds and creases that can be easily seen when looked for closely on any copy of the blue maps or charts.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>The most striking, and unusual, feature of these maps is of course the blue color that sets them apart from other Chinese maps, and indeed maps from any other part of the world, produced at the time. Scientific spectral analysis of three copies of the terrestrial maps and one copy of a celestial blue map by the Weissman Preservation Center at Harvard University and Microtrace in Elgin Illinois, have confirmed the pigment to be Prussian Blue. Prussian blue, a ferric (iron) hexacyanoferrate, was first synthesized accidentally in Berlin by Johann Jacob Diesbach, a Swiss painter and colormaker, in 1706. Its production is a complex and time-consuming process of acidic additives into a crystalline distillation with resulting varying sized crystals that can be filtered to create different tones of blue (note the two tones of blue used on the terrestrial map, see entry 3). The blue maps and charts were produced around the time when Chinese manufacturers learned to make the pigment locally and were less dependent on imports. The discovery of the use of Prussian blue in the case of the blue maps and charts is historically significant as it demonstrates the first large-scale use of Prussian blue for printing in China, and East Asia, in the first decades of the nineteenth century.</p>\n<p>The blue maps and charts were popular, with ten editions (from forty-six extant copies) for the terrestrial map and four editions (from thirteen extent copies) of the celestial chart identified thus far.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup> The consumption and display techniques of the blue maps and charts hint to their popularity in Japan. The maps and charts were intended to be mounted as sets of multiple (eight) hanging scrolls arranged as a continuous image in a Chinese style known as the panoramic screen (<em>tongjing ping</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">通景屏</span>), with no borders or gaps in between the scrolls, and a one-color border (<em>yise biao</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">一色裱</span>) in minimal proportions done in paper or brocade below and at the top of each scroll. And, in general, when the printed sheets were mounted in China this was the presentation style. The sheets however were also sold and distributed as unmounted sheets.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup> The maps and charts were soon popular in Japan and arrived as eight unmounted sheets. This is evidenced by the numerous mounting styles fabricated in Japan. The maps and charts can still be found mounted as hanging scrolls, folded screens (<em>byōbu</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">屏風</span>, see entry 3), sliding doors (<em>fusuma</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">襖</span>), and folded sheet maps. The Japanese style mounting of the folded sheet map has two covers, mounted on the back of the map in opposite corners of the map proper, that protect the map when folded. In the case of the hanging scroll style (original Chinese style) in Japan, a two-color mount style (<em>erse biao</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">二色裱</span>, and different from the Chinese style) using two separate border colors was used, the preferred style in Japan.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup> The number of still extent blue maps and charts mounted in Japanese styles attests to their popularity in Japan.</p>\n<p>Confirmation that the maps were intended to be mounted as hanging scrolls, can be found in the title slips extant on many prints of the terrestrial maps (see entry 3). These title slips were printed vertically and stacked on the far-right exterior edge of the first sheet for most editions.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup> The map’s title, in an abbreviated form (<em>Da Qing yitong dili quantu</em>), is repeated eight times in individual rectangular framed boxes. In addition, these eight title slips are numbered in the bottom right corner of each slip, from top to bottom, one to eight. Typically, title slips were a small blank sheet of paper added during the mounting process to the exterior of the rolled hanging scroll (hanging scrolls are rolled when stored). After application to the scroll by the mount maker a title would be written on the slip. In other words, the title slips were typically produced by the mount maker, entirely separately from the printing process, and attached to the scroll when the work was mounted onto the backing paper that helps protect the original work. On the blue maps, however, these title slips were incorporated into the original printing process, even though they were not, technically, part of the map proper. It is quite unusual that title slips were part of the original printed work, to be removed by the mount maker. Mount makers would typically never alter the original work in any way. The title slips imply that the printer and mount maker, typically unrelated craftsmen, collaborated, or at least that the production team seriously considered the mount maker as part of the project. The intentional inclusion of these eight slips indicates that the maps were to be mounted as hanging scrolls, with the title slips cut off, separated and placed outside the mount as labels on the exterior of the rolled scrolls; again a highly unusual production model. What is interesting to note is that the printed sheets were distributed to Japan as loose sheets, where mounters kept the title slips attached when mounting the maps (see entry 3). As demonstrated above, the production of the blue maps and charts are unusual in historical (Chinese, East Asian and World) mapmaking through using a low-grade Xuan paper and unique in three ways, rubbing printing method, title slips, and in use of Prussian blue.</p>\n<h2>Makers</h2>\n<p>Suzhou, one of the economic and intellectual centers of the Qing empire at the time of the blue maps and charts production and throughout much of China’s imperial history, appears on all signed editions, of thus far unidentified persons and or their studios, of the terrestrial map as a place of production. Only the last edition of the blue celestial chart dated to the fifth month of 1826 is signed by a known personage, Qian Yong (1759–1844). Qian Yong was a poet and author as well as an accomplished calligrapher of the so-called stone stele (<em>bei</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">碑</span>) school of calligraphy, traveling extensively throughout China collecting samples of rubbings from stone stele. That a calligrapher was part of the design of the blue celestial maps should come as no surprise. All celestial editions can be divided by calligraphic types into three different styles, unusual for a single object. The first section is dedicated to the large eight-character title in seal script (<em>zhuanshu</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">篆書</span>), while the last section contains an inscription in clerical script (<em>lishu</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">隸書</span>), giving some general information about the chart, which differs between the 1822 and the 1826 editions. The main text written in standard script (<em>kaishu</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">楷書</span>) on six sheets, is structured along sixteen section heads demarcated by white boxes with blue character titles. That the celestial map was designed with multiple styles of calligraphy suggests a calligrapher, like Qian Yong, designed the text layout and that he participated in the creation of all four editions.</p>\n<p>In late imperial China, the collecting, making of rubbings and copying of calligraphy found on ancient stone stele (<em>bei</em>), and the rubbings of calligraphy on ancient bronze vessels or from copy books of calligraphy (<em>tie</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">帖</span>) schools of calligraphy were both popular. These two schools of collecting and related collecting practices originated in the seventeenth century amongst groups of scholars, artists, collectors, and calligraphers that formed social groups around literary, collecting, and artistic practices of common interest, often sharing and collaborating with each other.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">7</a></sup> These types of scholarly groups were in a period of revival in the early nineteenth century with well-known scholar/painter/calligrapher/rubbings collectors including Yi Bingshou <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">伊秉綬</span> (1755–1815) who wrote sixteen quatrain poems on famous model rubbings. Qian Yong was likely active in similar groups and discussions among such groups which probably contributed to the creation of the blue maps and charts. No doubt the proximity to the two 1247 map steles, the <em>Dili tu</em> and <em>tianwen tu</em> (see entries 1 and 2), themselves in the Confucian temple in Suzhou also helps explain Qian Yong’s interest in the blue map and chart project, as he was an avid stele-school follower himself.</p>\n<h2>Models</h2>\n<p>This exhibition especially emphasizes three different historical models for the blue maps and charts; a particular typology (unique to East Asia) of administrative mapping, the Huang family legacy and the cosmological/astrological pairing of a terrestrial map and celestial chart.</p>\n<h2>Administrative Mapping</h2>\n<p>Luo Hongxian’s (1504-64) <em>Enlarged Territorial Atlas</em> (<em>Guangyu tu</em>, see catalogue entry 5) dated 1566, includes maps of the eighteen provinces of late Ming dynasty (1368-1644) China. Luo created twenty-four standardized symbols, found in a key, associated with census figures, military information and tributary reports and placed them next to place names, in the earliest use in China of an “encoded toponym.” The use of geometric shapes in association with toponyms and administration is a characteristic of a typology of Chinese mapmaking that visually links places with the people of those places beginning in the late Ming dynasty. The blue terrestrial maps use a key and a conceptually similar system, except the toponyms were placed inside the encoded shapes.</p>\n<p>By encoding administrative units with a geometric shape and thus visually prioritizing administration over geography, the people living in each administrative unit become important, as does the relationship of each toponym with the surrounding ones in an administrative hierarchy of the entire empire (by mapping placenames that are presented relationally as opposed to geometrically/to scale to each other). Each toponym is encoded through a shape that ties it immediately to the administration and a social structure. If we consider these encoded toponyms as presenting a specifically Chinese paradigm of a socio-political order that has a familial framework, then the entire terrestrial blue map can be understood as presenting the paradigm of an idealized order that is the Qing empire. Within a specifically Chinese context this type of socio-political order with a familial framework was proposed and implemented by Confucius (551-479 BCE) and his followers as a method to promote peace and stability on micro and macro scales. That is not to say that these maps are explicitly Confucian in any way but that the blue terrestrial maps present similar paradigms. These maps visualize the correlative relationships of a Chinese cosmological order found between the toponyms, geography, social structures, and the people that inhabit those spaces. The micro-scale familial relationships and social structure essential in understanding the macro-scale frameworks of the Qing realm and its mapping are valued and these maps precisely present the hierarchy visually.</p>\n<h2>Huang family legacy</h2>\n<p>In the preface of the blue terrestrial map the authors credit as their principal source Huang Qianren’s (<span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">黃千人</span> 1694–1771)), a student at the National University and later a low-ranking official, 1767 map titled <em>Complete map of the everlasting Great Qing unified all under heaven</em> (<em>Da Qing wannian yitong tianxia quantu)</em>. Huang in turn, on his 1767 map, credits his grandfather’s, Huang Zongxi <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">黃宗羲</span> (1610–1695), map of the early Qing empire (<em>Yudi quantu)</em> dated to 1673. The general layout and administrative emphasis, in particular the use of encoded toponyms, of the blue terrestrial maps thus lay in the legacy of the Huang family’s map making.</p>\n<p>Two other maps in the exhibition claim the same lineage to the Huang family. The large lower map of Ma Junliang’s (jinshi 1761) <em>Capital Edition of the complete map (based on) astronomy</em> (<em>Jingban tianwen quantu</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">京板天文全圖</span>), from circa 1795, also claims to be based on Huang Qianren’s 1767 map (see catalogue entry 6). And Zhu Xiling’s <em>Complete all under heaven map of the everlasting unified Qing empire</em> (<em>Daqing yitong tianxia quantu</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">大清一統天下全圖</span>), dated to 1818, follows the same lineage (see catalogue entry 7).</p>\n<h2>Cosmological/astrological Pairing</h2>\n<p>The terrestrial maps conceptually and visually prioritize multiple “inner” and “outer” historical administrative frameworks that participate in Chinese familial practices set within a standardized infrastructure of geophysical and manmade attributes (see entry 3). The celestial charts present a planisphere of stars and constellations in conjunction with geographic and planetary correlations while surrounding texts present important celestial mechanics (see entry 4).</p>\n<p>Although the two maps can function separately, and each emerge from their own unique historical trajectories they should be understood conceptually as part of a larger cosmological framework. Modern analytic examinations typically ignore the combination of celestial and terrestrial mapping, preferring to polarize and separate the two map types (the terrestrial is considered geographic and historical while the celestial is scientific). This exhibition and related catalogue rectifies this trend. These maps were meant to be considered together in relationships and correlations participating in a long historical tradition established since at least the stone steles <em>Dili tu</em> (<em>Geographical Map</em>) and the <em>Tianwen tu</em> <em>(Celestial Chart</em>) carved in 1247 (See catalogue entries 1 and 2). This is confirmed in the epilogue of the 1822 edition of the celestial chart where both of the 1247 map and chart are specifically cited. The titles of the blue map and chart provide further confirmation. First, the terrestrial map specifically used the term <em>dili</em> (terrestrial) in the title at a time when the preference was to use the term <em>tianxia</em> (all under heaven, see entry 7).[^8] And second, both titles use the binomial terms <em>yitong</em> (unified) and <em>quantu</em> (complete map or chart) as a connecting linkage. While the use of these binomial terms is not unusual for the terrestrial map they are highly unusual for a celestial chart confirming the two terms are meant to connect and couple the blue map and chart and thus to function in the same manner as the 1247 map and chart. Conceptually functioning like the thirteenth century steles, the blue maps (although greatly expanded, updated, and differing completely in their materiality) show the territory and administrative structure of Qing China with some surrounding regions as combined with a planisphere of all the known stars. As a result, the subtle and covert political implications (see entry 1) found on the combined 1247 map and chart presented by ethnically Han officials longing for an earlier (and thus idealized) Han Chinese based political structure are reactivated (in a <em>gujin</em> paradigm, see entry 6), in an equally subtle and covert manner, through the blue maps and charts during the early nineteenth century by ethnically Han scholars in Suzhou (not the capital of Beijing) longing for a time and political structure from before Manchu rule.</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>The author has based considerations of the production and consumption models using the larger data sets of extent examples of both the maps and charts. <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>The printing process was first confirmed through microscopic examination at the Weissman Preservation Center at Harvard University, and has subsequently been confirmed on numerous examples of both terrestrial and celestial blue maps.

One of them is a terrestrial map titled Dili tu <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">墬理圖</span> (Geographical map) and the other a celestial chart titled Tianwen tu <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">天文圖</span>.  The scholar Huang Shang <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">黃裳</span> (1146–1194), active in the Southern Song (1126–1279) court, created both these maps in the 1190s, and subsequently Wang Zhiyuan <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">王致远</span> (1193–1257) had them engraved on stone in 1247 and since that time rubbings on paper have been made of these maps. Huang’s two maps were first meant to be combined to present ideal cosmological models for the young Prince Jia, the future Ningzong <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">寧宗</span> Emperor (r. 1194-1224) on good governance. The viewer was meant to visualize that good governance through the correlative properties between heaven and earth found on the micro scale within each of the two maps and on the macro scale in consideration of the entire empire with the two maps combined. Over 600 years after the creation of the steles, Chinese scholars in the city of Suzhou decided to create their own, albeit in blue, updated images of heaven and earth so closely linked to their own city.</p> <p>The dili tu illustrates 368 prefectures, 623 military bases, 73 rivers, 27 lakes, 180 mountains and 24 passes.

One of them is a terrestrial map titled Dili tu <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">墬理圖</span> (Geographical map) and the other a celestial chart titled Tianwen tu <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">天文圖</span>.  The scholar Huang Shang <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">黃裳</span> (1146–1194), active in the Southern Song (1126–1279) court, created both these maps in the 1190s, and subsequently Wang Zhiyuan <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">王致远</span> (1193–1257) had them engraved on stone in 1247 and since that time rubbings on paper have been made of these maps. Huang’s two maps were first meant to be combined to present ideal cosmological models for the young Prince Jia, the future Ningzong <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">寧宗</span> Emperor (r. 1194-1224) on good governance. The viewer was meant to visualize that good governance through the correlative properties between heaven and earth found on the micro scale within each of the two maps and on the macro scale in consideration of the entire empire with the two maps combined. Over 600 years after the creation of the steles, Chinese scholars in the city of Suzhou decided to create their own, albeit in blue, updated images of heaven and earth so closely linked to their own city.</p> <p>The dili tu illustrates 368 prefectures, 623 military bases, 73 rivers, 27 lakes, 180 mountains and 24 passes.

It sets them apart from other Chinese maps, and indeed maps from any other part of the world produced at the time. Scientific spectral analysis, first conducted at the Weissman Preservation Center at Harvard University, has confirmed the pigment to be Prussian blue.</p> <p>Prussian blue, an iron-based compound, was first synthesized accidentally in Berlin by Johann Jacob Diesbach, a Swiss painter and colormaker, in 1706. Its production is a complex and time-consuming chemical process, which results in varying sized crystals that can be filtered to create different tones of blue—like the two tones of blue used on the terrestrial map.</p> <p>The blue maps and charts were produced around the time when Chinese manufacturers learned to make the pigment locally and were less dependent on European imports. The discovery of the use of Prussian blue in the case of these maps and charts is historically significant as it demonstrates the first large-scale use of Prussian blue for printing in China, and East Asia, in the first decades of the nineteenth century.</p> </div> </aside>\n<div></div> <aside class=\"crosslink-box\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <h3> <p>Woodblock Rubbings</p> </h3> <div class=\"crosslink-body\"><p>The blue maps and charts were made using woodblocks. They contrast to the typical manner of woodblock printing where a negative image is carved into the block and paper pressed into the inked block produces a positive image. Printing using the rubbing method is comparatively very labor intensive and time consuming, creating a unique print each time. Historically in China, it is highly unusual to print a rubbing from woodblocks, creating a positive image from a positive block, especially at the scale of these blue maps and charts.</p> </div> </aside>\n<section id=\"section-catalog-essay\" class=\"accordion-section\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <h2>Catalog essay</h2> <p>Several Geophysical attributes can be easily distinguished in the overall visual presentation of this map of the Qing empire; such as the two vivid white lines of the Yellow River (north) and the Yangzi River (south) which divide the empire east and west. Just north of the Yellow River is the band of white “desert dots” of the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts running from the third to the eighth panel. Surrounding much of the empire is the wave patterned oceans from the Atlantic (top left) to the Pacific (half of panel two on the right) and seas. There are two prominent man-made structures as well. The Great Wall, with its distinctive crenelated wall pattern, which runs between the Yellow River and the Gobi Desert. The other manmade structure shown is the lesser-known Willow Palisade (<em>liutiaobian</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">柳條邊</span>), which emerges close to where the Great Wall ends and enters the sea and is demarcated by cross-hatched lines. The Willow Palisade is the symbolic barrier protecting the Manchu homeland within which are located the Manchu imperial tombs, the “eastern capital” <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">東京</span> or “secondary capital,” Shengjing <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">盛京</span> (m. Mukden) and the Imperial hunting grounds.</p> <p>The typology of this map is administrative using specifically the device of an encoded toponym first used in Luo Hongxian’s <em>Guang yutu</em> (see entry 5) for a type of map unique to East Asia. The majority of the eight sheets is taken up by displaying the administrative structure of the Qing empire into an inner and an outer sphere, although the exact boundaries between these two spheres are intentionally ambiguous.</p> <p>The inner sphere is made up of the eighteen provinces of “China proper” and is populated with encoded toponyms (fig.) linking placenames to administrative unit types (prefectures, sub-prefectures, counties, and so forth) that are identified in the key found in the preface at the bottom right (fig.). The use of geometric shapes in association with toponyms and administration visually links places with the people of those places. By encoding administrative units with a geographic shape and thus visually prioritizing administration over territory, the people living in each administrative unit become important, as does the relation of each toponym with the surrounding ones in an administrative hierarchy of the entire empire. The administrative coding visually and easily enables a snapshot of the entire administrative, communications, and tax systems.</p> <p>While the inner portion of the maps focuses on the administrative framework of the Qing empire by presenting encoded toponyms, the outer sphere is made up of a surrounding ring of text blocks (labeled fig.), with no borders of any kind, associated with states that have official relations, and geographic proximity, with the Qing empire and are described on the map as places that “bring tribute” (<em>chaogong</em>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> These include a range of non-Qing entities, including Russia, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, and Korea, as visually unbounded spaces. These outer entities, as text blocks, also require administrative attention, albeit from separate governmental agencies. The outer sphere entities were generally governed by ranked local administrators in specific cities that reported to the Ministry of Rites and included Annam (today’s Vietnam), Burma (today’s Myanmar), the Ryukyu (Okinawa) Islands, and Siam (today’s Thailand). Russia (fig.), also presented as part of this outer sphere, was administered by the Board for Governing Outer Territories (ch. Lifanyuan <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">理藩院</span>; manch. <em>Tulergi golo be darasa jurgan</em>). Only Joseon Korea (fig.) was given special privilege, communicating with no intermediary body but directly with the Ministry of Rites in Beijing.</p> <p>The maps also present an ambiguous third sphere, between the inner and outer. This in-between sphere is made up of the regions conquered and integrated into the Qing empire in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries: Mongolia, Tibet, Xinjiang, and Taiwan. On the blue maps, these regions include both administrative units encoded by shape as well as short annotations similar to those for the non-Qing regions, taking on elements from both the inner and outer spheres.</p> <p>Geographical and topographical elements like oceans, mountains and rivers are embedded throughout the entire map, linking the inner, outer, and in-between spheres in a grand vision of Qing space. Frontiers were not sites of separation but sites of relationality acting as bridges connecting people, things and ideas. By using toponyms that were encoded to reflect the humanity (administrative bodies) of all places in the empire operating within a Chinese familial framework, this type of map presents, visually, systems for maintaining all the empire’s relationships, internal and external or inner and outer. It can be understood to conceptually manifest an idealized and harmonious empire that emphasized an historically stable core of eighteen ethnically Han provinces surrounded by other related non-Han entities. The celestial blue maps will introduce another component of an intended larger cosmological order that ultimately unites heaven and earth.</p> <section class=\"footnotes\"> <ol class=\"footnotes-list\"> <li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>The term “bring tribute” reflects official relations and affiliations between the Qing empire and the “tribute bringing” countries, using a vocabulary from the point of view of the Chinese state.

The majority of the eight sheets is taken up by displaying the administrative structure of the Qing empire into an inner and an outer sphere, although the exact boundaries between these two spheres are intentionally ambiguous.</p> <p>The inner sphere is made up of the eighteen provinces of “China proper” and is populated with encoded toponyms (fig.) linking placenames to administrative unit types (prefectures, sub-prefectures, counties, and so forth) that are identified in the key found in the preface at the bottom right (fig.). The use of geometric shapes in association with toponyms and administration visually links places with the people of those places. By encoding administrative units with a geographic shape and thus visually prioritizing administration over territory, the people living in each administrative unit become important, as does the relation of each toponym with the surrounding ones in an administrative hierarchy of the entire empire. The administrative coding visually and easily enables a snapshot of the entire administrative, communications, and tax systems.</p> <p>While the inner portion of the maps focuses on the administrative framework of the Qing empire by presenting encoded toponyms, the outer sphere is made up of a surrounding ring of text blocks (labeled fig.), with no borders of any kind, associated with states that have official relations, and geographic proximity, with the Qing empire and are described on the map as places that “bring tribute” (<em>chaogong</em>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> These include a range of non-Qing entities, including Russia, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, and Korea, as visually unbounded spaces. These outer entities, as text blocks, also require administrative attention, albeit from separate governmental agencies. The outer sphere entities were generally governed by ranked local administrators in specific cities that reported to the Ministry of Rites and included Annam (today’s Vietnam), Burma (today’s Myanmar), the Ryukyu (Okinawa) Islands, and Siam (today’s Thailand). Russia (fig.), also presented as part of this outer sphere, was administered by the Board for Governing Outer Territories (ch. Lifanyuan <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">理藩院</span>; manch. <em>Tulergi golo be darasa jurgan</em>). Only Joseon Korea (fig.) was given special privilege, communicating with no intermediary body but directly with the Ministry of Rites in Beijing.</p> <p>The maps also present an ambiguous third sphere, between the inner and outer. This in-between sphere is made up of the regions conquered and integrated into the Qing empire in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries: Mongolia, Tibet, Xinjiang, and Taiwan. On the blue maps, these regions include both administrative units encoded by shape as well as short annotations similar to those for the non-Qing regions, taking on elements from both the inner and outer spheres.</p> <p>Geographical and topographical elements like oceans, mountains and rivers are embedded throughout the entire map, linking the inner, outer, and in-between spheres in a grand vision of Qing space. Frontiers were not sites of separation but sites of relationality acting as bridges connecting people, things and ideas. By using toponyms that were encoded to reflect the humanity (administrative bodies) of all places in the empire operating within a Chinese familial framework, this type of map presents, visually, systems for maintaining all the empire’s relationships, internal and external or inner and outer. It can be understood to conceptually manifest an idealized and harmonious empire that emphasized an historically stable core of eighteen ethnically Han provinces surrounded by other related non-Han entities. The celestial blue maps will introduce another component of an intended larger cosmological order that ultimately unites heaven and earth.</p> <section class=\"footnotes\"> <ol class=\"footnotes-list\"> <li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>The term “bring tribute” reflects official relations and affiliations between the Qing empire and the “tribute bringing” countries, using a vocabulary from the point of view of the Chinese state. As the Qing state preferred to segment and localize its external relations through ranked local administrators to monitor foreign entities and provide a direct and trusted conduit for intelligence to Beijing from the frontier, the Ministry of Rites regulated that officials from each country had to use a specific city to enter the Qing empire. <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p> </li> </ol> </section> </section> </details>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n</div>\n","length":2641,"title":"Complete Geographical Map of the Everlasting Unified Qing Empire","type":"entry","url":"http://localhost:8080/catalogue/3/"},{"content":"<section id=\"section-about-this-object\" class=\"accordion-section\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <h2>About this object</h2> <p>In this blue celestial chart, printed in 1826, most of the body text is identical to that on the <a href=\"/catalogue/2/\"><em>Celestial Chart</em> rubbing</a> (<span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">天文圖</span> <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">Tianwen tu</span>) from 1247.

The celestial chart’s design with multiple styles of calligraphy suggests that a calligrapher, like Qian, designed the text layout.

Luo Hongxian (<span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">羅洪先</span> 1504-64) in his well-known <em>Guang yutu</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">廣與圖</span> (<em>Expansive terrestrial atlas</em>) created the earliest atlas in China that was first printed in circa 1555.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> This slightly later edition, dated to 1566, has forty-six maps within the atlas, each with a grid called a <em>jili huafeng</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">計里畫方</span>, its own scale and a descriptive preface. The first map, the <em>Complete terrestrial map</em> (<em>Yudi zongtu</em>), became a model for Qing map makers and was the foundation for the Huang family maps (see essay, entries 3, 6 and 7) and eventually the blue terrestrial map, although it does not include, notably, the great wall.</p> <p>In the Ming and Qing dynasties, administrators were responsible for supplying statistics about their administrative bodies. Based on census figures, military information and tributary reports Luo Hongxian created his atlas. That information, in Luo’s atlas, was converted into twenty-four standardized symbols that are found in a key, the earliest use of an “encoded toponym.” Luo used different geometric shapes in combination with accompanying text to provide information that included administrative systems, residences and land taxes, garrisons and troop numbers, and roads.</p> <p>While the grid is absent from the blue maps and only alluded to in the introduction, keying administrative units to specific shapes can be found both on the <em>Guang yutu</em> and the blue maps.

Luo Hongxian (<span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">羅洪先</span> 1504-64) in his well-known <em>Guang yutu</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">廣與圖</span> (<em>Expansive terrestrial atlas</em>) created the earliest atlas in China that was first printed in circa 1555.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> This slightly later edition, dated to 1566, has forty-six maps within the atlas, each with a grid called a <em>jili huafeng</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">計里畫方</span>, its own scale and a descriptive preface. The first map, the <em>Complete terrestrial map</em> (<em>Yudi zongtu</em>), became a model for Qing map makers and was the foundation for the Huang family maps (see essay, entries 3, 6 and 7) and eventually the blue terrestrial map, although it does not include, notably, the great wall.</p> <p>In the Ming and Qing dynasties, administrators were responsible for supplying statistics about their administrative bodies. Based on census figures, military information and tributary reports Luo Hongxian created his atlas. That information, in Luo’s atlas, was converted into twenty-four standardized symbols that are found in a key, the earliest use of an “encoded toponym.” Luo used different geometric shapes in combination with accompanying text to provide information that included administrative systems, residences and land taxes, garrisons and troop numbers, and roads.</p> <p>While the grid is absent from the blue maps and only alluded to in the introduction, keying administrative units to specific shapes can be found both on the <em>Guang yutu</em> and the blue maps. Luo Hongxian’s prototype presented the shapes and toponyms differently than on the blue maps: Instead of encircling the toponyms with the shape, the <em>Guang yutu</em> shows the symbols next to the names as can be seen in the <em>Map of Zhejiang Province</em> (<em>Zhejiang yutu</em>, fig.).</p> <p>The encoded toponyms present the micro-scale Ming or Qing Chinese familial relationships and social structure essential in understanding the macro-scale frameworks of the Ming or Qing Chinese realm and its mapping as valued by the state, presenting the hierarchy visually. The atlas visually presented the tax base and therefore income of the state and enabled an easy understanding of administrative and military divisions along with avenues of communication.

The Huang family lineage began with <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">Huang Zongxi</span> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">黃宗羲</span> (1610–95) and his 1673 <em>Complete Map of China</em> (<span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">輿地全圖</span> <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">Yudi quantu</span>), a map modeled from the 1555 <em>Complete Terrestrial Map</em> (<span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">輿地總圖</span> <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">Yudi zongtu</span>) created by Luo Hongxian <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">羅洪先</span>. Huang’s map was amended and updated by his grandson <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">Huang Qianren</span> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">黃千人</span> (1694–1771) as a multicolored woodblock-printed map in 1767 with the title <em>All Under Heaven Complete Map of the Everlasting Unified Qing Empire</em> (<span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">大清萬年一統天下全圖</span> <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">Daqing wannian yitong tianxia quantu</span>).
