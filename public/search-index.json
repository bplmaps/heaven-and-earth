[{"content":"<p>During the first decades of the nineteenth century, China was in a moment of transition, grappling with its geopolitical status as both an ancient and modern nation-state. The power of the Qing dynasty had just reached its zenith, establishing a vast territory of political and cultural influence over a multiethnic, geographically dispersed population. Chinese scholars and artists were reconsidering the ideological and practical significance of the imperial realm. Meanwhile, European ideas and goods were arriving in China, bringing both new opportunities and challenges.</p>\n<p>It was in this moment that two series of large-format maps, one terrestrial and one celestial, were printed in the city of Suzhou. These maps were presented in an extraordinary format, on eight vertical sheets printed in the style of rubbings. Even more strikingly, they were rendered in a rich blue coloring. The pigment Prussian blue had recently begun to be produced in China, and these maps were amongst the first printed objects in East Asia to make use of the colorant—predating the famous use of Prussian blue by Japanese print artists soon after.</p>\n<p>The blue maps were more than just visually astonishing. They also captured Chinese ideas about the relationship between terrestrial and celestial space, and still provide insight today into how Chinese scholars and artists conceptualized the world around them. Beautiful and powerful in equal measure, these blue maps capture details of a transitional moment in the history of China—and the wider world. This exhibition considers these two maps in the context of their production, consumption, and functionality, revealing them as unique objects in the global history of mapmaking.</p>\n<div class=\"visit-splash\">\n<p><em>Heaven &amp; Earth</em> is on display at the Leventhal Map &amp; Education Center at the Boston Public Library from May 11 through August 31, 2024.

By stitching the points of light in the night sky together into constellations, human culture inserts the loom of interpretation between the universe and our understanding of it. Constellations thus offer a particularly useful starting point for thinking about the troublesome relationship between what actually exists in the world and the cultural systems that intermediate our knowledge of that existence. Are constellations real or imaginary, natural or artificial, out in the world or just in our heads?</p>\n<figure id=\"constellation-zoom\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#constellation-zoom\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Zoomed in view of star chart\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/banners/celestial_zoom.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Detail of <a href=\"/catalogue/4/\">Complete Map of the Unified Star Configurations in the Heavens</a></span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Zoomed in view of star chart\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/banners/celestial_zoom.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Detail of <a href=\"/catalogue/4/\">Complete Map of the Unified Star Configurations in the Heavens</a></span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>Of course, they are clearly a bit of both: there aren’t <em>really</em> dippers, or plows, or swans, or ancient heroes in the sky. But those designs aren’t sketched on a blank canvas. The location and arrangement of the stars is actually real, and, at least on the scale of human lifetimes, immutable. What is more, we don’t each make up the constellations from our own individual imaginations alone; they’re handed down through shared cultures, such that we can speak meaningfully with someone who shares our reference system about the Big Dipper as if it really <em>were</em> a thing out in the world and not just a made-up figure in our heads.</p>\n<p>A star constellation obviously confounds this distinction between what is known and what is “real,” but the same confusion is also at play in the terrestrial world. We may speak meaningfully about such geographic objects as cities, regions, prefectures, or empires as if the fact of their existence inheres in the shape of the world itself. But upon closer examination, these also turn out to hover somewhere between imagination and reality. There’s only a United States of America or a Guangdong province or any other geographic unit insofar as we collectively agree to recognize such objects—much like dippers and plows in the sky.</p>\n<p>Unlike star constellations, these terrestrial formations play an instrumental role in politics and power, which is why rulers and administrators have always been so keen to map them and to fix them into place through mechanisms ranging from taxation to census tabulation. In <em>Heaven &amp; Earth,</em> we see this double process of bringing cartographic order to the terrestrial and celestial worlds as it played out in Qing China. In the Chinese cosmographic tradition, heaven and earth were intimately related to one another. The patterns sketched out from the arrangement of the night sky offered practical guidance for how to conceptualize the world on the ground—and also how to govern it. When bureaucrats and functionaries aggregated statistical and administrative information from across the domain of the “<a href=\"/catalogue/7/\">unified all under heaven</a>” Qing territory, and condensed the information into the figures and symbols of the terrestrial maps on display in <em>Heaven &amp; Earth,</em> they were engaging in a form of knowledge systematization that was more than just circumstantially related to the work of astronomers and cosmographers who traced lines in the skies.</p>\n<p>The formal connection between the celestial and terrestrial maps on display in <em>Heaven &amp; Earth</em>—their twin derivation from <a href=\"/catalogue/1/\">stone stele rubbings</a> and their unique use of the <a href=\"/catalogue/3/\">Prussian blue colorant</a>—offers a prompt to think about how cultures come to make sense of both celestial and terrestrial space by gathering, structuring, and representing knowledge. Whether in dippers in the sky or districts on the ground, plows or provinces, the work of cartographers etches our imaginary systems of order onto the world.</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"gnelson"}],"length":651,"title":"On Making Constellations","type":"essay","url":"https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/heaven-and-earth/intro/"},{"content":"<p>In China, during the early decades of the nineteenth century, two series of large format maps, one terrestrial and one celestial, were printed between 1812 and 1826 in the city of Suzhou, one of the economic and intellectual centers of the Chinese empire at the time and throughout much of China’s imperial history. The terrestrial maps, of which most of the ten editions are entitled <em>Geographical Complete Map of the Everlasting Unified Qing Empire</em> (<span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">大清萬年一統地理全圖</span> <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">Daqing wannian yitong dili quantu</span>), present the realm of the Qing Empire (1644–1911) and selected surrounding regions. The four extant editions of the celestial maps entitled <em>Complete Map of Unified Star Configurations in the Heavens</em> (<span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">渾天壹統星象全圖</span> <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">Huntian yitong xingxiang quantu</span>), dated to 1822 and 1826, present a planisphere of all the known stars and extensive descriptions of known celestial bodies and their related celestial mechanics. This catalogue essay considers these two maps in the contexts of their interconnected “4 M’s;” that is methods, materials, makers and models; while the catalogue entries provide information about the content of each of the maps and charts included in the exhibition.</p>\n<h2>Methods and Materials</h2>\n<p>The methods and materials for the production and consumption of the blue maps and charts are unique in cartographic history, not only locally in East Asia but within the larger world.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> Both maps and charts were produced on eight sheets of Chinese <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">宣</span> <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">xuan</span> paper in three unique manners; the paper, the printing method and the blue colorant. While the associated mounting and consumption practices are also unique.</p>\n<p>Xuan paper, made primarily in Anhui and Zhejiang provinces, was principally blue sandalwood (Tara Wingceltis, <em>Ulmus Cavaleriei</em>, known in Chinese as <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">青檀</span> <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">qingdan</span>), a deciduous tree found throughout China, mixed with differing degrees of rice plant fibers. In the case of the blue maps and charts, a low grade xuan type paper was used, one with less blue sandalwood fibers and more rice plant fiber fill. The paper used was unusual, between a low-cost bamboo paper typical of rubbings (a printing technique) and a high-cost sandalwood paper typical of painting and calligraphy.</p>\n<p>The blue maps follow closely the aesthetics of a print production known as a rubbing. This printing production methodology began in the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE). The manner of presentation of white characters on a solid color, here blue, should be understood within the context of historical Chinese practices associated with making rubbings from stone stele and ancient bronzes. In China, rubbings were an essential component of long-established epigraphic study and associated collecting practices, as well as specific calligraphic practices. To make a rubbing from an engraved stone stele, slightly moistened paper would be fixed on a prepared, flattened smooth then carved, stone. The moist paper would be manipulated using brushes and pointed sticks, pressing the paper into the recessed areas of the carved stone. An inked (typically in black) dauber (fabric over cotton wadding) would be tamped down onto the paper-covered stone. The ink would adhere to the “raised” paper making the areas of carved away stone appear in white. In this process a positive image is carved on the stone, and a positive image is created on the inked paper. This contrasts to the typical manner of woodblock printing where a negative image is carved into the block, the block is then inked and the paper pressed onto the inked block with the ink transferring to the paper, making for a positive image on the paper. In other words, typical woodblock printing creates a positive image from a negative block.</p>\n<p>The blue maps and charts production adhere this process of making rubbings from stone steles, but through printing from woodblocks instead of stone. Like a stone stele, a positive image would be carved into a wooden block that was then used to print in the manner of a rubbing. Historically in China, it is highly unusual to print from woodblocks a positive image from a positive block, especially at this scale. Woodblock printing typically was used to create more easily and quickly multiple similar copies of any given work. Printing in the manner of a rubbing is comparatively very labor intensive and time consuming, creating essentially a unique print each time. Through close visual analysis of the printed paper, the rubbing method of production using woodblocks can easily be seen on the blue maps and charts. As already noted, during the printing process the moistened paper was pressed and stretched into the negative space of the carved woodblock, furthest for the large characters of the title. After printing, when the finished print was to be mounted, the paper was pressed flat and glued to an additional paper backing. The resulting “stretch marks,” formed during the printing process, became folds and creases that can be easily seen when looked for closely on any copy of the blue maps or charts.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>The most striking, and unusual, feature of these maps is of course the blue color that sets them apart from other Chinese maps, and indeed maps from any other part of the world, produced at the time. Scientific spectral analysis of three copies of the terrestrial maps and one copy of a celestial blue map by the Weissman Preservation Center at Harvard University and Microtrace in Elgin Illinois, have confirmed the pigment to be Prussian Blue. Prussian blue, a ferric (iron) hexacyanoferrate, was first synthesized accidentally in Berlin by Johann Jacob Diesbach, a Swiss painter and colormaker, in 1706. Its production is a complex and time-consuming process of acidic additives into a crystalline distillation with resulting varying sized crystals that can be filtered to create different tones of blue (note the two tones of blue used on the terrestrial map, see <a href=\"/catalogue/3/\">entry 3</a>). The blue maps and charts were produced around the time when Chinese manufacturers learned to make the pigment locally and were less dependent on imports. The discovery of the use of Prussian blue in the case of the blue maps and charts is historically significant as it demonstrates the first large-scale use of Prussian blue for printing in China, and East Asia, in the first decades of the nineteenth century.</p>\n<p>The blue maps and charts were popular, with ten editions (from forty-six extant copies) for the terrestrial map and four editions (from thirteen extent copies) of the celestial chart identified thus far.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup> The consumption and display techniques of the blue maps and charts hint to their popularity in Japan. The maps and charts were intended to be mounted as sets of multiple (eight) hanging scrolls arranged as a continuous image in a Chinese style known as the panoramic screen (<span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">通景屏</span> <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">tongjing ping</span>), with no borders or gaps in between the scrolls, and a one-color border (<span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">一色裱</span> <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">yise biao</span>) in minimal proportions done in paper or brocade below and at the top of each scroll. And, in general, when the printed sheets were mounted in China this was the presentation style. The sheets however were also sold and distributed as unmounted sheets.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup> The maps and charts were soon popular in Japan and arrived as eight unmounted sheets. This is evidenced by the numerous mounting styles fabricated in Japan. The maps and charts can still be found mounted as hanging scrolls, folded screens (<span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">屏風</span> <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">byōbu</span>, see <a href=\"/catalogue/3/\">entry 3</a>), sliding doors (<span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">襖</span> <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">fusuma</span>), and folded sheet maps. The Japanese style mounting of the folded sheet map has two covers, mounted on the back of the map in opposite corners of the map proper, that protect the map when folded. In the case of the hanging scroll style (original Chinese style) in Japan, a two-color mount style (<span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">二色裱</span> <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">erse biao</span>, and different from the Chinese style) using two separate border colors was used, the preferred style in Japan.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup> The number of still extent blue maps and charts mounted in Japanese styles attests to their popularity in Japan.</p>\n<p>Confirmation that the maps were intended to be mounted as hanging scrolls, can be found in the title slips extant on many prints of the terrestrial maps (see <a href=\"/catalogue/3/\">entry 3</a>). These title slips were printed vertically and stacked on the far-right exterior edge of the first sheet for most editions.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup> The map’s title, in an abbreviated form (<span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">Da Qing yitong dili quantu</span>), is repeated eight times in individual rectangular framed boxes. In addition, these eight title slips are numbered in the bottom right corner of each slip, from top to bottom, one to eight. Typically, title slips were a small blank sheet of paper added during the mounting process to the exterior of the rolled hanging scroll (hanging scrolls are rolled when stored). After application to the scroll by the mount maker a title would be written on the slip. In other words, the title slips were typically produced by the mount maker, entirely separately from the printing process, and attached to the scroll when the work was mounted onto the backing paper that helps protect the original work. On the blue maps, however, these title slips were incorporated into the original printing process, even though they were not, technically, part of the map proper. It is quite unusual that title slips were part of the original printed work, to be removed by the mount maker. Mount makers would typically never alter the original work in any way. The title slips imply that the printer and mount maker, typically unrelated craftsmen, collaborated, or at least that the production team seriously considered the mount maker as part of the project. The intentional inclusion of these eight slips indicates that the maps were to be mounted as hanging scrolls, with the title slips cut off, separated and placed outside the mount as labels on the exterior of the rolled scrolls; again a highly unusual production model. What is interesting to note is that the printed sheets were distributed to Japan as loose sheets, where mounters kept the title slips attached when mounting the maps (see <a href=\"/catalogue/3/\">entry 3</a>). As demonstrated above, the production of the blue maps and charts are unusual in historical (Chinese, East Asian and World) mapmaking through using a low-grade Xuan paper and unique in three ways, rubbing printing method, title slips, and in use of Prussian blue.</p>\n<h2>Makers</h2>\n<p>Suzhou, one of the economic and intellectual centers of the Qing empire at the time of the blue maps and charts production and throughout much of China’s imperial history, appears on all signed editions, of thus far unidentified persons and or their studios, of the terrestrial map as a place of production. Only the last edition of the blue celestial chart dated to the fifth month of 1826 is signed by a known personage, Qian Yong (1759–1844). Qian Yong was a poet and author as well as an accomplished calligrapher of the so-called stone stele (<span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">碑</span> <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">bei</span> ) school of calligraphy, traveling extensively throughout China collecting samples of rubbings from stone stele. That a calligrapher was part of the design of the blue celestial maps should come as no surprise. All celestial editions can be divided by calligraphic types into three different styles, unusual for a single object. The first section is dedicated to the large eight-character title in seal script (<span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">篆書</span> <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">zhuanshu</span>), while the last section contains an inscription in clerical script (<span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">隸書</span> <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">lishu</span>), giving some general information about the chart, which differs between the 1822 and the 1826 editions. The main text written in standard script (<span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">楷書</span> <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">kaishu</span>) on six sheets, is structured along sixteen section heads demarcated by white boxes with blue character titles. That the celestial map was designed with multiple styles of calligraphy suggests a calligrapher, like Qian Yong, designed the text layout and that he participated in the creation of all four editions.</p>\n<p>In late imperial China, the collecting, making of rubbings and copying of calligraphy found on ancient stone stele (<em>bei</em>), and the rubbings of calligraphy on ancient bronze vessels or from copy books of calligraphy (<span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">帖</span> <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">tie</span>) schools of calligraphy were both popular. These two schools of collecting and related collecting practices originated in the seventeenth century amongst groups of scholars, artists, collectors, and calligraphers that formed social groups around literary, collecting, and artistic practices of common interest, often sharing and collaborating with each other.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">7</a></sup> These types of scholarly groups were in a period of revival in the early nineteenth century with well-known scholar/painter/calligrapher/rubbings collectors including Yi Bingshou <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">伊秉綬</span> (1755–1815) who wrote sixteen quatrain poems on famous model rubbings. Qian Yong was likely active in similar groups and discussions among such groups which probably contributed to the creation of the blue maps and charts. No doubt the proximity to the two 1247 map steles, the <em>Dili tu</em> and <em>tianwen tu</em> (see entries <a href=\"/catalogue/1/\">1</a> and <a href=\"/catalogue/2/\">2</a>), themselves in the Confucian temple in Suzhou also helps explain Qian Yong’s interest in the blue map and chart project, as he was an avid stele-school follower himself.</p>\n<h2>Models</h2>\n<p>This exhibition especially emphasizes three different historical models for the blue maps and charts; a particular typology (unique to East Asia) of administrative mapping, the Huang family legacy and the cosmological/astrological pairing of a terrestrial map and celestial chart.</p>\n<h2>Administrative Mapping</h2>\n<p>Luo Hongxian’s (1504-64) <em>Enlarged Territorial Atlas</em> (<em>Guangyu tu</em>, see catalogue entry 5) dated 1566, includes maps of the eighteen provinces of late Ming dynasty (1368-1644) China. Luo created twenty-four standardized symbols, found in a key, associated with census figures, military information and tributary reports and placed them next to place names, in the earliest use in China of an “encoded toponym.” The use of geometric shapes in association with toponyms and administration is a characteristic of a typology of Chinese mapmaking that visually links places with the people of those places beginning in the late Ming dynasty. The blue terrestrial maps use a key and a conceptually similar system, except the toponyms were placed inside the encoded shapes.</p>\n<p>By encoding administrative units with a geometric shape and thus visually prioritizing administration over geography, the people living in each administrative unit become important, as does the relationship of each toponym with the surrounding ones in an administrative hierarchy of the entire empire (by mapping placenames that are presented relationally as opposed to geometrically/to scale to each other). Each toponym is encoded through a shape that ties it immediately to the administration and a social structure. If we consider these encoded toponyms as presenting a specifically Chinese paradigm of a socio-political order that has a familial framework, then the entire terrestrial blue map can be understood as presenting the paradigm of an idealized order that is the Qing empire. Within a specifically Chinese context this type of socio-political order with a familial framework was proposed and implemented by Confucius (551-479 BCE) and his followers as a method to promote peace and stability on micro and macro scales. That is not to say that these maps are explicitly Confucian in any way but that the blue terrestrial maps present similar paradigms. These maps visualize the correlative relationships of a Chinese cosmological order found between the toponyms, geography, social structures, and the people that inhabit those spaces. The micro-scale familial relationships and social structure essential in understanding the macro-scale frameworks of the Qing realm and its mapping are valued and these maps precisely present the hierarchy visually.</p>\n<h2>Huang family legacy</h2>\n<p>In the preface of the blue terrestrial map the authors credit as their principal source Huang Qianren’s <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">黃千人</span> (1694–1771), a student at the National University and later a low-ranking official, 1767 map titled <em>Complete map of the everlasting Great Qing unified all under heaven</em> (<em>Da Qing wannian yitong tianxia quantu)</em>. Huang in turn, on his 1767 map, credits his grandfather’s, Huang Zongxi <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">黃宗羲</span> (1610–1695), map of the early Qing empire (<em>Yudi quantu)</em> dated to 1673. The general layout and administrative emphasis, in particular the use of encoded toponyms, of the blue terrestrial maps thus lay in the legacy of the Huang family’s map making.</p>\n<p>Two other maps in the exhibition claim the same lineage to the Huang family. The large lower map of Ma Junliang’s (jinshi 1761) <em>Capital Edition of the complete map (based on) astronomy</em> (<span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">京板天文全圖</span> <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">Jingban tianwen quantu</span>), from circa 1795, also claims to be based on Huang Qianren’s 1767 map (see catalogue entry 6). And Zhu Xiling’s <em>Complete all under heaven map of the everlasting unified Qing empire</em> (<span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">大清一統天下全圖</span> <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">Daqing yitong tianxia quantu</span>), dated to 1818, follows the same lineage (see catalogue entry 7).</p>\n<h2>Cosmological/Astrological Pairing</h2>\n<p>The terrestrial maps conceptually and visually prioritize multiple “inner” and “outer” historical administrative frameworks that participate in Chinese familial practices set within a standardized infrastructure of geophysical and manmade attributes (see <a href=\"/catalogue/3/\">entry 3</a>). The celestial charts present a planisphere of stars and constellations in conjunction with geographic and planetary correlations while surrounding texts present important celestial mechanics (see <a href=\"/catalogue/4/\">entry 4</a>).</p>\n<p>Although the two maps can function separately, and each emerge from their own unique historical trajectories they should be understood conceptually as part of a larger cosmological framework. Modern analytic examinations typically ignore the combination of celestial and terrestrial mapping, preferring to polarize and separate the two map types (the terrestrial is considered geographic and historical while the celestial is scientific). This exhibition and related catalogue rectifies this trend. These maps were meant to be considered together in relationships and correlations participating in a long historical tradition established since at least the stone steles <em>Dili tu</em> (<em>Geographical Map</em>) and the <em>Tianwen tu</em> <em>(Celestial Chart</em>) carved in 1247 (See catalogue entries 1 and 2). This is confirmed in the epilogue of the 1822 edition of the celestial chart where both of the 1247 map and chart are specifically cited. The titles of the blue map and chart provide further confirmation. First, the terrestrial map specifically used the term <em>dili</em> (terrestrial) in the title at a time when the preference was to use the term <em>tianxia</em> (all under heaven, see <a href=\"/catalogue/7/\">entry 7</a>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">8</a></sup> And second, both titles use the binomial terms <em>yitong</em> (unified) and <em>quantu</em> (complete map or chart) as a connecting linkage. While the use of these binomial terms is not unusual for the terrestrial map they are highly unusual for a celestial chart confirming the two terms are meant to connect and couple the blue map and chart and thus to function in the same manner as the 1247 map and chart. Conceptually functioning like the thirteenth century steles, the blue maps (although greatly expanded, updated, and differing completely in their materiality) show the territory and administrative structure of Qing China with some surrounding regions as combined with a planisphere of all the known stars.</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>The author has based considerations of the production and consumption models using the larger data sets of extent examples of both the maps and charts. <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>The printing process was first confirmed through microscopic examination at the Weissman Preservation Center at Harvard University, and has subsequently been confirmed on numerous examples of both terrestrial and celestial blue maps.

Qian was an accomplished calligrapher and collector who traveled extensively around China collecting samples of rubbings from stele. The celestial chart’s design with multiple styles of calligraphy suggests that a calligrapher, like Qian, designed the text layout.

The remaining six sheets present a planisphere and related celestial information using standard script.</p> <p>The main text body on the 1826 editions of the blue charts essentially copies the text of the 1247 <em>Tianwen tu</em> stele (see entry 2). The sections are clearly indicated by headings, presenting the Chinese characters in blue on white, while the primary text is white on a blue field; the same aesthetic found on the terrestrial maps.</p> <p>The central and most eye-catching part of this chart is the planisphere.

It reads counterclockwise (in the manner of the rotation of the night sky to an observer on earth) and indicates numerous directional signifiers, as also found on the 1247 <em>Tianwen tu</em>. The chart is printed in such a way that the characters always face outward. When the planisphere is “rotated” (conceptually as the physical object is too large) to the time of observation the characters at the “bottom” are always right side up and in a position to be easily read. They are rather technical and require an astronomical and astrological knowledge base. The directional signifiers include the relative widths of the twenty-eight lunar mansions, the twelve terrestrial branches (<em>chen</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">辰</span>), twelve Jupiter positions or zodiacal positions (<em>ci</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">次</span>), and the corresponding states and provinces under the astral allocation system (<em>fenye</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">分野</span>, also known as field-allocation). This division into twelve parts under the astral allocation system had been in astrological use since the late fifth century BCE and correlates celestial and terrestrial space.</p> <p>For example, the section at the bottom of the chart with the “first” branch <em>zi</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">子</span> (north), is in the <em>yuanxiao</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">元枵</span> position, corresponding to the ancient state of Qi <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">齊</span> and Qingzhou province <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">青州</span> (today’s Shandong province, see entry 2). This horizon band of the blue charts provides astrological cues and emphasizes the intended functionality of correlations and correspondences between heaven and earth that are to be interpreted by man. The blue charts, like the <em>Tianwen tu</em>, clearly indicate that specific sets of constellations are tied to the ancient twelve provinces of China. A direct correlation between heaven and earth is thus embedded into the chart itself. This conceptual consideration can be further applied to the overall framing of the combined two blue map and chart, which are created as a pair, terrestrial and celestial, and modeled on the 1247 <em>dili tu</em> and <em>tianwen tu</em>, maintaining the correlative properties between heaven and earth, within a Chinese cultural sphere.</p> <p>The final sheet (missing on the Adler copy) has an epilogue that simply states the purpose of the map: To explain heavenly bodies. It is dated May 1826 (sixth year of Daoguang reign, fourth month <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">道光六年歲在丙戊孟夏之月</span>) and signed by Qian Yong from Jingui <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">金匱梅溪钱泳書</span>. Of all the ten editions of the terrestrial map and the four editions of the celestial map this is the final and only edition that has a signature of a known maker for the blue maps and charts. Qian Yong was a poet and author as well as an accomplished calligrapher of the so-called stone stele (<em>bei</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">碑</span>) school of calligraphy, traveling extensively around China collecting samples of rubbings from stele. That the celestial chart was designed with multiple styles of calligraphy suggests a calligrapher, like Qian Yong, designed the text layout and that he participated in the creation of all four editions. That the production of all the maps and charts are done in the manner of rubbings suggests a collector of rubbings suggested this method. And that the two stele that the blue map and chart are modeled after were, and still are, found in the city of Suzhou and the blue maps and charts were all produced in the city of Suzhou suggests that Qian Yong participated in all phases of production.</p> <section class=\"footnotes\"> <ol class=\"footnotes-list\"> <li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>In many cases the constellations are updated on the blue charts in comparison to the 1247 chart with additional stars discovered by Europeans (since the discovery of the telescope) and introduced into Chinese star charts by Europeans working in the Chinese court from the seventeenth century onwards. <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p> </li> </ol> </section> </section> <details class=\"accordion-section\" id=\"section-catalog-essay\"  data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <summary class=\"accordion-section__heading accordion-section__heading-level-2 accordion-section__controls accordion-section__controls--arrow\" tabindex=\"1\"> <button aria-label=\"Copy page section link to clipboard\" class=\"accordion-section__copy-link-button\" data-outputs-exclude=\"pdf,epub\" value=\"#section-catalog-essay\" tabindex=\"2\" > # </button> <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"accordion-tooltip\" data-outputs-exclude=\"pdf,epub\" > Copied page section link to clipboard </span> <h2>Catalog essay</h2> </summary> <section class=\"accordion-section__body\"><p>The blue <em>Huntian yitong xingxiang quantu</em> (Complete chart of unified star configurations in the heavens) are star charts with related celestial information.

This division into twelve parts under the astral allocation system had been in astrological use since the late fifth century BCE and correlates celestial and terrestrial space.</p> <p>For example, the section at the bottom of the chart with the “first” branch <em>zi</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">子</span> (north), is in the <em>yuanxiao</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">元枵</span> position, corresponding to the ancient state of Qi <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">齊</span> and Qingzhou province <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">青州</span> (today’s Shandong province, see entry 2). This horizon band of the blue charts provides astrological cues and emphasizes the intended functionality of correlations and correspondences between heaven and earth that are to be interpreted by man. The blue charts, like the <em>Tianwen tu</em>, clearly indicate that specific sets of constellations are tied to the ancient twelve provinces of China. A direct correlation between heaven and earth is thus embedded into the chart itself. This conceptual consideration can be further applied to the overall framing of the combined two blue map and chart, which are created as a pair, terrestrial and celestial, and modeled on the 1247 <em>dili tu</em> and <em>tianwen tu</em>, maintaining the correlative properties between heaven and earth, within a Chinese cultural sphere.</p> <p>The final sheet (missing on the Adler copy) has an epilogue that simply states the purpose of the map: To explain heavenly bodies. It is dated May 1826 (sixth year of Daoguang reign, fourth month <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">道光六年歲在丙戊孟夏之月</span>) and signed by Qian Yong from Jingui <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">金匱梅溪钱泳書</span>. Of all the ten editions of the terrestrial map and the four editions of the celestial map this is the final and only edition that has a signature of a known maker for the blue maps and charts. Qian Yong was a poet and author as well as an accomplished calligrapher of the so-called stone stele (<em>bei</em> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">碑</span>) school of calligraphy, traveling extensively around China collecting samples of rubbings from stele. That the celestial chart was designed with multiple styles of calligraphy suggests a calligrapher, like Qian Yong, designed the text layout and that he participated in the creation of all four editions. That the production of all the maps and charts are done in the manner of rubbings suggests a collector of rubbings suggested this method. And that the two stele that the blue map and chart are modeled after were, and still are, found in the city of Suzhou and the blue maps and charts were all produced in the city of Suzhou suggests that Qian Yong participated in all phases of production.</p> <section class=\"footnotes\"> <ol class=\"footnotes-list\"> <li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>In many cases the constellations are updated on the blue charts in comparison to the 1247 chart with additional stars discovered by Europeans (since the discovery of the telescope) and introduced into Chinese star charts by Europeans working in the Chinese court from the seventeenth century onwards. <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p> </li> </ol> </section> </section> </details>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n</div>\n","length":2596,"title":"Complete Map of Unified Star Configurations in the Heavens","type":"entry","url":"https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/heaven-and-earth/catalogue/4/"},{"content":"<section id=\"section-about-this-object\" class=\"accordion-section\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <h2>About this object</h2> <p>Part of the methodology and visual presentation of mapping Qing dynasty China was formulated in the mid-sixteenth century during the late Ming dynasty (1368–1644). <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">Luo Hongxian</span> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">羅洪先</span> (1504–64) created the earliest atlas in China, the <em>Enlarged Territorial Atlas</em> (<span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">廣與圖</span> <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">Guangyu tu</span>), which was first printed around 1555.

The Chinese term <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">圖</span> <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">tu</span> can translate into a number of different meanings like diagram, picture, map, painting, and so forth, all related to rendering three-dimensional space onto a two-dimensional plane. Historically, local administrators, both civil and military, were required to compile data sets and produce these <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">tu</span>. The <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">tu</span> considered here are those most associated with cartography, as they functioned as management tools for taxation, resource allocation, agricultural planning, travel, military strategy, and as symbols of ownership and authority. They often provided information like population densities, geophysical characteristics of place, types of buildings (religious, civil, military), local resources, and so forth.</p>\n<p>These <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">tu</span> typically lack a uniform or specific style of appearance but were designed for instrumental purposes. In other words, makers were less concerned with what the <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">tu</span> looked like and focused on what they did and how they functioned. For example, the <span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">tu</span> often do not have a uniform scale.

The circuits were divided into prefectures (<span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">fu</span>), independent departments (<span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">zhilizhou</span>), and independent subprefectures (<span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">zhiliting</span>). The prefectures were divided into counties (<span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">xian</span>), departments (<span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">zhou</span>), and subprefectures (<span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">ting</span>). Thus, the blue terrestrial map provides a very accurate and detailed breakdown of the administrative structure for the entire empire in a single image.</p>\n<p>A few of the geometric symbols on the blue Qing map are the same shapes as those found in the Luo’s earlier Ming dynasty atlas key. The difference being Luo placed the symbols by the toponyms and the blue map imbeds the toponym in the shape. These encoded toponyms, although using different visual presentations, conceptually function in the same manner. The use of geometric shapes in association with toponyms and administration is a characteristic of a typology of Chinese mapmaking that visually links places with the people of those places. This encoding visually prioritizes administration over territory, the people living in each administrative unit become more important than depicting information according to scale or geometry, as does the relational spacing of each toponym with the surrounding ones in an administrative hierarchy of the entire empire.</p>\n<p>This manner of encoding toponyms is unique to Chinese administrative maps. They reflect the human system (administrative bodies like prefectures, sub-prefectures, counties, and so forth) of all places in the empire conceptually operating within a Chinese familial framework. If we consider these encoded toponyms as presenting a specifically Chinese paradigm of a socio-political order that has a familial framework, then the entire atlas and terrestrial blue map can be understood as presenting the paradigm of an idealized order that is the Ming or Qing empire. Within a specifically Chinese context this type of socio-political order with a familial framework was first proposed and implemented by Confucius (551–479 BCE) and his followers as a method to promote peace and stability on micro and macro scales. That is not to say that these maps are explicitly Confucian in any way but that they present similar paradigms. Confucianism, in its original formulation, before it was assimilated with other religious and ritual practices, is understood to be structured, on the micro-scale, as relationships between individuals within a family then applied, on the macro-scale, to relationships between individuals and humanity and then scaled up to groups and the larger world. A set of principles—including benevolence (<span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">ren</span> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">仁</span>), righteousness (<span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">yi</span> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">義</span>), propriety (<span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">li</span> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">禮</span>), wisdom (<span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">zhi</span> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">智</span>), sincerity (<span class=\"inline-characters romanization-characters\">xin</span> <span class=\"inline-characters chinese-characters\">信</span>) and others—were created to maintain harmony and stability on the micro and macro scales. Each toponym is encoded through a shape that ties it immediately to the administration and a social structure.</p>\n<p>The types of maps presented here visualize relationships within a Chinese administrative order found between the toponyms, geography, social structures, and the people that inhabit those spaces. The micro-scale familial relationships and social structure essential in understanding the macro-scale frameworks of the Ming and Qing realm and its mapping are valued and these maps precisely present the hierarchy visually.</p>\n<h2>Further Reading</h2>\n<p>Fuchs, Walter 1946. <em>The &quot;Mongol Atlas&quot; of China by Chu Ssu-pen and the Kuang-yü-t'u : with 48 facsimile maps dating from about 1555</em>, Fu Jen University, Peiping (Beijing).</p>\n<p>Pegg, Richard A., 2024. <em>Heaven and Earth: The Blue Maps of China</em>, exh cat., Leventhal Map and Education Center, Boston Public Library.</p>\n<p>Pegg, Richard A., 2024. “The Blue Terrestrial Map of China in the WereldMuseum, Leiden.” <em>Provenance</em>, WereldMuseum, Leiden, no. 5.</p>\n<p>Pegg, Richard A. and Papelitzky, Elke, 2024. “The Blue Maps of China: Considerations of Materiality and Function in China and Japan,” in <em>Maps and Colours</em>, Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany, Brill, ch. 14, pp. 190-204.</p>\n<p>Pegg, Richard A. and Papelitzky, Elke, forthcoming. <em>The Chinese Blue Maps: Correlating Heaven and Earth in the Early 19th Century</em>, MacLean Collection and University of Chicago Press.</p>\n<p>Wang, Michelle 2023. <em>The Art of Terrestrial Diagrams in Early China</em>.
