The terrestrial maps, of which most of<br>\nthe ten editions are entitled <em>Geographical</em> <em>Complete Map of the<br>\nEverlasting Unified Qing Empire</em> (<em>Daqing wannian yitong dili quantu</em><br>\n大清萬年一統地理全圖), present the realm of the Qing Empire (1644–1911)<br>\nand selected surrounding regions. The four extant editions of the<br>\ncelestial maps entitled <em>Complete Map of Unified Star Configurations in<br>\nthe Heavens</em> (<em>Huntian yitong xingxiang quantu</em> 渾天壹統星象全圖), dated<br>\nto 1822 and 1826, present a planisphere of all the known stars and<br>\nextensive descriptions of known celestial bodies and their related<br>\ncelestial mechanics. This catalogue essay considers these two maps in<br>\nthe contexts of their interconnected “4 M’s;” that is methods,<br>\nmaterials, makers and models; while the catalogue entries provide<br>\ninformation about the content of each of the maps and charts included in<br>\nthe exhibition.</p>\n<h2>Methods and Materials</h2>\n<p>The methods and materials for the production and consumption of the blue<br>\nmaps and charts are unique in cartographic history, not only locally in<br>\nEast Asia but within the larger world.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> Both maps and charts were<br>\nproduced on eight sheets of Chinese <em>xuan</em> 宣 paper in three unique<br>\nmanners; the paper, the printing method and the blue colorant. While the<br>\nassociated mounting and consumption practices are also unique.</p>\n<p>Xuan paper, made primarily in Anhui and Zhejiang provinces, was<br>\nprincipally blue sandalwood (Tara Wingceltis, L. <em>Ulmus Cavaleriei</em>, C.<br>\n<em>qingdan</em> 青檀), a deciduous tree found throughout China, mixed with<br>\ndiffering degrees of rice plant fibers. In the case of the blue maps and<br>\ncharts, a low grade <em>xuan</em> type paper was used, one with less blue<br>\nsandalwood fibers and more rice plant fiber fill. The paper used was<br>\nunusual, between a low-cost bamboo paper typical of rubbings (a printing<br>\ntechnique) and a high-cost sandalwood paper typical of painting and<br>\ncalligraphy.</p>\n<p>The blue maps follow closely the aesthetics of a print production known<br>\nas a rubbing. This printing production methodology began in the Tang<br>\ndynasty (618-907 CE). The manner of presentation of white characters on<br>\na solid color, here blue, should be understood within the context of<br>\nhistorical Chinese practices associated with making rubbings from stone<br>\nstele and ancient bronzes. In China, rubbings were an essential<br>\ncomponent of long-established epigraphic study and associated collecting<br>\npractices, as well as specific calligraphic practices. To make a rubbing<br>\nfrom an engraved stone stele, slightly moistened paper would be fixed on<br>\na prepared, flattened smooth then carved, stone. The moist paper would<br>\nbe manipulated using brushes and pointed sticks, pressing the paper into<br>\nthe recessed areas of the carved stone. An inked (typically in black)<br>\ndauber (fabric over cotton wadding) would be tamped down onto the<br>\npaper-covered stone. The ink would adhere to the “raised” paper making<br>\nthe areas of carved away stone appear in white. In this process a<br>\npositive image is carved on the stone, and a positive image is created<br>\non the inked paper. This contrasts to the typical manner of woodblock<br>\nprinting where a negative image is carved into the block, the block is<br>\nthen inked and the paper pressed onto the inked block with the ink<br>\ntransferring to the paper, making for a positive image on the paper. In<br>\nother words, typical woodblock printing creates a positive image from a<br>\nnegative block.</p>\n<p>The blue maps and charts production adhere this process of making<br>\nrubbings from stone steles, but through printing from woodblocks instead<br>\nof stone. Like a stone stele, a positive image would be carved into a<br>\nwooden block that was then used to print in the manner of a rubbing.<br>\nHistorically in China, it is highly unusual to print from woodblocks a<br>\npositive image from a positive block, especially at this scale.<br>\nWoodblock printing typically was used to create more easily and quickly<br>\nmultiple similar copies of any given work. Printing in the manner of a<br>\nrubbing is comparatively very labor intensive and time consuming,<br>\ncreating essentially a unique print each time. Through close visual<br>\nanalysis of the printed paper, the rubbing method of production using<br>\nwoodblocks can easily be seen on the blue maps and charts. As already<br>\nnoted, during the printing process the moistened paper was pressed and<br>\nstretched into the negative space of the carved woodblock, furthest for<br>\nthe large characters of the title. After printing, when the finished<br>\nprint was to be mounted, the paper was pressed flat and glued to an<br>\nadditional paper backing. The resulting “stretch marks,” formed during<br>\nthe printing process, became folds and creases that can be easily seen<br>\nwhen looked for closely on any copy of the blue maps or charts.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>The most striking, and unusual, feature of these maps is of course the<br>\nblue color that sets them apart from other Chinese maps, and indeed maps<br>\nfrom any other part of the world, produced at the time. Scientific<br>\nspectral analysis of three copies of the terrestrial maps and one copy<br>\nof a celestial blue map by the Weissman Preservation Center at Harvard<br>\nUniversity and Microtrace in Elgin Illinois, have confirmed the pigment<br>\nto be Prussian Blue. Prussian blue, a ferric (iron) hexacyanoferrate,<br>\nwas first synthesized accidentally in Berlin by Johann Jacob Diesbach, a<br>\nSwiss painter and colormaker, in 1706. Its production is a complex and<br>\ntime-consuming process of acidic additives into a crystalline<br>\ndistillation with resulting varying sized crystals that can be filtered<br>\nto create different tones of blue (note the two tones of blue used on<br>\nthe terrestrial map, see entry 3). The blue maps and charts were<br>\nproduced around the time when Chinese manufacturers learned to make the<br>\npigment locally and were less dependent on imports. The discovery of the<br>\nuse of Prussian blue in the case of the blue maps and charts is<br>\nhistorically significant as it demonstrates the first large-scale use of<br>\nPrussian blue for printing in China, and East Asia, in the first decades<br>\nof the nineteenth century.</p>\n<p>The blue maps and charts were popular, with ten editions (from forty-six<br>\nextant copies) for the terrestrial map and four editions (from thirteen<br>\nextent copies) of the celestial chart identified thus far.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup> The<br>\nconsumption and display techniques of the blue maps and charts hint to<br>\ntheir popularity in Japan. The maps and charts were intended to be<br>\nmounted as sets of multiple (eight) hanging scrolls arranged as a<br>\ncontinuous image in a Chinese style known as the panoramic screen<br>\n(<em>tongjing ping</em> 通景屏), with no borders or gaps in between the<br>\nscrolls, and a one-color border (<em>yise biao</em> 一色裱) in minimal<br>\nproportions done in paper or brocade below and at the top of each<br>\nscroll. And, in general, when the printed sheets were mounted in China<br>\nthis was the presentation style. The sheets however were also sold and<br>\ndistributed as unmounted sheets.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup> The maps and charts were soon<br>\npopular in Japan and arrived as eight unmounted sheets. This is<br>\nevidenced by the numerous mounting styles fabricated in Japan. The maps<br>\nand charts can still be found mounted as hanging scrolls, folded screens<br>\n(<em>byōbu</em> 屏風, see entry 3), sliding doors (<em>fusuma</em> 襖), and folded<br>\nsheet maps. The Japanese style mounting of the folded sheet map has two<br>\ncovers, mounted on the back of the map in opposite corners of the map<br>\nproper, that protect the map when folded. In the case of the hanging<br>\nscroll style (original Chinese style) in Japan, a two-color mount style<br>\n(<em>erse biao</em> 二色裱, and different from the Chinese style) using two<br>\nseparate border colors was used, the preferred style in Japan.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup> The<br>\nnumber of still extent blue maps and charts mounted in Japanese styles<br>\nattests to their popularity in Japan.</p>\n<p>Confirmation that the maps were intended to be mounted as hanging<br>\nscrolls, can be found in the title slips extant on many prints of the<br>\nterrestrial maps (see entry 3). These title slips were printed<br>\nvertically and stacked on the far-right exterior edge of the first sheet<br>\nfor most editions.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup> The map’s title, in an abbreviated form (<em>Da Qing<br>\nyitong dili quantu</em>), is repeated eight times in individual rectangular<br>\nframed boxes. In addition, these eight title slips are numbered in the<br>\nbottom right corner of each slip, from top to bottom, one to eight.<br>\nTypically, title slips were a small blank sheet of paper added during<br>\nthe mounting process to the exterior of the rolled hanging scroll<br>\n(hanging scrolls are rolled when stored). After application to the<br>\nscroll by the mount maker a title would be written on the slip. In other<br>\nwords, the title slips were typically produced by the mount maker,<br>\nentirely separately from the printing process, and attached to the<br>\nscroll when the work was mounted onto the backing paper that helps<br>\nprotect the original work. On the blue maps, however, these title slips<br>\nwere incorporated into the original printing process, even though they<br>\nwere not, technically, part of the map proper. It is quite unusual that<br>\ntitle slips were part of the original printed work, to be removed by the<br>\nmount maker. Mount makers would typically never alter the original work<br>\nin any way. The title slips imply that the printer and mount maker,<br>\ntypically unrelated craftsmen, collaborated, or at least that the<br>\nproduction team seriously considered the mount maker as part of the<br>\nproject. The intentional inclusion of these eight slips indicates that<br>\nthe maps were to be mounted as hanging scrolls, with the title slips cut<br>\noff, separated and placed outside the mount as labels on the exterior of<br>\nthe rolled scrolls; again a highly unusual production model. What is<br>\ninteresting to note is that the printed sheets were distributed to Japan<br>\nas loose sheets, where mounters kept the title slips attached when<br>\nmounting the maps (see entry 3). As demonstrated above, the production<br>\nof the blue maps and charts are unusual in historical (Chinese, East<br>\nAsian and World) mapmaking through using a low-grade Xuan paper and<br>\nunique in three ways, rubbing printing method, title slips, and in use<br>\nof Prussian blue.</p>\n<h2>Makers</h2>\n<p>Suzhou, one of the economic and intellectual centers of the Qing empire<br>\nat the time of the blue maps and charts production and throughout much<br>\nof China’s imperial history, appears on all signed editions, of thus far<br>\nunidentified persons and or their studios, of the terrestrial map as a<br>\nplace of production. Only the last edition of the blue celestial chart<br>\ndated to the fifth month of 1826 is signed by a known personage, Qian<br>\nYong (1759–1844). Qian Yong was a poet and author as well as an<br>\naccomplished calligrapher of the so-called stone stele (<em>bei</em> 碑) school<br>\nof calligraphy, traveling extensively throughout China collecting<br>\nsamples of rubbings from stone stele. That a calligrapher was part of<br>\nthe design of the blue celestial maps should come as no surprise. All<br>\ncelestial editions can be divided by calligraphic types into three<br>\ndifferent styles, unusual for a single object. The first section is<br>\ndedicated to the large eight-character title in seal script (<em>zhuanshu</em><br>\n篆書), while the last section contains an inscription in clerical script<br>\n(<em>lishu</em> 隸書), giving some general information about the chart, which<br>\ndiffers between the 1822 and the 1826 editions. The main text written in<br>\nstandard script (<em>kaishu</em> 楷書) on six sheets, is structured along<br>\nsixteen section heads demarcated by white boxes with blue character<br>\ntitles. That the celestial map was designed with multiple styles of<br>\ncalligraphy suggests a calligrapher, like Qian Yong, designed the text<br>\nlayout and that he participated in the creation of all four editions.</p>\n<p>In late imperial China, the collecting, making of rubbings and copying<br>\nof calligraphy found on ancient stone stele (<em>bei</em>), and the rubbings of<br>\ncalligraphy on ancient bronze vessels or from copy books of calligraphy<br>\n(<em>tie</em> 帖) schools of calligraphy were both popular. These two schools<br>\nof collecting and related collecting practices originated in the<br>\nseventeenth century amongst groups of scholars, artists, collectors, and<br>\ncalligraphers that formed social groups around literary, collecting, and<br>\nartistic practices of common interest, often sharing and collaborating<br>\nwith each other.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">7</a></sup> These types of scholarly groups were in a period of<br>\nrevival in the early nineteenth century with well-known<br>\nscholar/painter/calligrapher/rubbings collectors including Yi Bingshou<br>\n伊秉綬 (1755–1815) who wrote sixteen quatrain poems on famous model<br>\nrubbings. Qian Yong was likely active in similar groups and discussions<br>\namong such groups which probably contributed to the creation of the blue<br>\nmaps and charts. No doubt the proximity to the two 1247 map steles, the<br>\n<em>Dili tu</em> and <em>tianwen tu</em> (see entries 1 and 2), themselves in the<br>\nConfucian temple in Suzhou also helps explain Qian Yong’s interest in<br>\nthe blue map and chart project, as he was an avid stele-school follower<br>\nhimself.</p>\n<h2>Models</h2>\n<p>This exhibition especially emphasizes three different historical models<br>\nfor the blue maps and charts; a particular typology (unique to East<br>\nAsia) of administrative mapping, the Huang family legacy and the<br>\ncosmological/astrological pairing of a terrestrial map and celestial<br>\nchart.</p>\n<h2>Administrative Mapping</h2>\n<p>Luo Hongxian’s (1504-64) <em>Enlarged Territorial Atlas</em> (<em>Guangyu tu</em>, see<br>\ncatalogue entry 5) dated 1566, includes maps of the eighteen provinces<br>\nof late Ming dynasty (1368-1644) China. Luo created twenty-four<br>\nstandardized symbols, found in a key, associated with census figures,<br>\nmilitary information and tributary reports and placed them next to place<br>\nnames, in the earliest use in China of an “encoded toponym.” The use of<br>\ngeometric shapes in association with toponyms and administration is a<br>\ncharacteristic of a typology of Chinese mapmaking that visually links<br>\nplaces with the people of those places beginning in the late Ming<br>\ndynasty. The blue terrestrial maps use a key and a conceptually similar<br>\nsystem, except the toponyms were placed inside the encoded shapes.</p>\n<p>By encoding administrative units with a geographic shape and thus<br>\nvisually prioritizing administration over geography, the people living<br>\nin each administrative unit become important, as does the relationship<br>\nof each toponym with the surrounding ones in an administrative hierarchy<br>\nof the entire empire (by mapping placenames that are presented<br>\nrelationally as opposed to geometrically/to scale to each other). Each<br>\ntoponym is encoded through a shape that ties it immediately to the<br>\nadministration and a social structure. If we consider these encoded<br>\ntoponyms as presenting a specifically Chinese paradigm of a<br>\nsocio-political order that has a familial framework, then the entire<br>\nterrestrial blue map can be understood as presenting the paradigm of an<br>\nidealized order that is the Qing empire. Within a specifically Chinese<br>\ncontext this type of socio-political order with a familial framework was<br>\nproposed and implemented by Confucius (551-479 BCE) and his followers as<br>\na method to promote peace and stability on micro and macro scales. That<br>\nis not to say that these maps are explicitly Confucian in any way but<br>\nthat the blue terrestrial maps present similar paradigms. These maps<br>\nvisualize the correlative relationships of a Chinese cosmological order<br>\nfound between the toponyms, geography, social structures, and the people<br>\nthat inhabit those spaces. The micro-scale familial relationships and<br>\nsocial structure essential in understanding the macro-scale frameworks<br>\nof the Qing realm and its mapping are valued and these maps precisely<br>\npresent the hierarchy visually.</p>\n<h2>Huang family legacy</h2>\n<p>In the preface of the blue terrestrial map the authors credit as their<br>\nprincipal source Huang Qianren’s (黃千人 1694–1771)), a student at the<br>\nNational University and later a low-ranking official, 1767 map titled<br>\n<em>Complete map of the everlasting Great Qing unified all under heaven</em><br>\n(<em>Da Qing wannian yitong tianxia quantu)</em>. Huang in turn, on his 1767<br>\nmap, credits his grandfather’s, Huang Zongxi 黃宗羲 (1610–1695), map of<br>\nthe early Qing empire (<em>Yudi quantu)</em> dated to 1673. The general layout<br>\nand administrative emphasis, in particular the use of encoded toponyms,<br>\nof the blue terrestrial maps thus lay in the legacy of the Huang<br>\nfamily’s map making.</p>\n<p>Two other maps in the exhibition claim the same lineage to the Huang<br>\nfamily. The large lower map of Ma Junliang’s (jinshi 1761) <em>Capital<br>\nEdition of the complete map (based on) astronomy</em> (<em>Jingban tianwen<br>\nquantu</em> 京板天文全圖), from circa 1795, also claims to be based on Huang<br>\nQianren’s 1767 map (see catalogue entry 6). And Zhu Xiling’s <em>Complete<br>\nall under heaven map of the everlasting unified Qing empire</em> (<em>Daqing<br>\nyitong tianxia quantu</em> 大清一統天下全圖), dated to 1818, follows the<br>\nsame lineage (see catalogue entry 7).</p>\n<h2>Cosmological/astrological Pairing</h2>\n<p>The terrestrial maps conceptually and visually prioritize multiple<br>\n“inner” and “outer” historical administrative frameworks that<br>\nparticipate in Chinese familial practices set within a standardized<br>\ninfrastructure of geophysical and manmade attributes (see entry 3). The<br>\ncelestial charts present a planisphere of stars and constellations in<br>\nconjunction with geographic and planetary correlations while surrounding<br>\ntexts present important celestial mechanics (see entry 4).</p>\n<p>Although the two maps can function separately, and each emerge from<br>\ntheir own unique historical trajectories they should be understood<br>\nconceptually as part of a larger cosmological framework. Modern analytic<br>\nexaminations typically ignore the combination of celestial and<br>\nterrestrial mapping, preferring to polarize and separate the two map<br>\ntypes (the terrestrial is considered geographic and historical while the<br>\ncelestial is scientific). This exhibition and related catalogue<br>\nrectifies this trend. These maps were meant to be considered together in<br>\nrelationships and correlations participating in a long historical<br>\ntradition established since at least the stone steles <em>Dili tu</em><br>\n(<em>Geographical Map</em>) and the <em>Tianwen tu</em> <em>(Celestial Chart</em>) carved in<br>\n1247 (See catalogue entries 1 and 2). This is confirmed in the epilogue<br>\nof the 1822 edition of the celestial chart where both of the 1247 map<br>\nand chart are specifically cited. The titles of the blue map and chart<br>\nprovide further confirmation. First, the terrestrial map specifically<br>\nused the term <em>dili</em> (terrestrial) in the title at a time when the<br>\npreference was to use the term <em>tianxia</em> (all under heaven, see entry<br>\n7).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">8</a></sup> And second, both titles use the binomial terms <em>yitong</em><br>\n(unified) and <em>quantu</em> (complete map or chart) as a connecting linkage.<br>\nWhile the use of these binomial terms is not unusual for the terrestrial<br>\nmap they are highly unusual for a celestial chart confirming the two<br>\nterms are meant to connect and couple the blue map and chart and thus to<br>\nfunction in the same manner as the 1247 map and chart. Conceptually<br>\nfunctioning like the thirteenth century steles, the blue maps (although<br>\ngreatly expanded, updated, and differing completely in their<br>\nmateriality) show the territory and administrative structure of Qing<br>\nChina with some surrounding regions as combined with a planisphere of<br>\nall the known stars. As a result, the subtle and covert political<br>\nimplications (see entry 1) found on the combined 1247 map and chart<br>\npresented by ethnically Han officials longing for an earlier (and thus<br>\nidealized) Han Chinese based political structure are reactivated (in a<br>\n<em>gujin</em> paradigm, see entry 6), in an equally subtle and covert manner,<br>\nthrough the blue maps and charts during the early nineteenth century by<br>\nethnically Han scholars in Suzhou (not the capital of Beijing) longing<br>\nfor a time and political structure from before Manchu rule.</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>The author has based considerations of the production and<br>\nconsumption models using the larger data sets of extent examples of<br>\nboth the maps and charts. <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>The printing process was first confirmed through microscopic<br>\nexamination at the Weissman Preservation Center at Harvard<br>\nUniversity, and has subsequently been confirmed on numerous examples<br>\nof both terrestrial and celestial blue maps.

Just north of the Yellow River is the band of white “desert dots” of the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts running from the third to the eighth panel. Surrounding much of the empire is the wave patterned oceans from the Atlantic (top left) to the Pacific (half of panel two on the right) and seas. There are two prominent man-made structures as well. The Great Wall, with its distinctive crenelated wall pattern, which runs between the Yellow River and the Gobi Desert. The other manmade structure shown is the lesser-known Willow Palisade (<em>liutiaobian</em> 柳條邊), which emerges close to where the Great Wall ends and enters the sea and is demarcated by cross-hatched lines. The Willow Palisade is the symbolic barrier protecting the Manchu homeland within which are located the Manchu imperial tombs, the “eastern capital” 東京 or “secondary capital,” Shengjing 盛京 (m. Mukden) and the Imperial hunting grounds.</p> <p>The typology of this map is administrative using specifically the device of an encoded toponym first used in Luo Hongxian’s <em>Guang yutu</em> (see entry 5) for a type of map unique to East Asia. The majority of the eight sheets is taken up by displaying the administrative structure of the Qing empire into an inner and an outer sphere, although the exact boundaries between these two spheres are intentionally ambiguous.</p> <p>The inner sphere is made up of the eighteen provinces of “China proper” and is populated with encoded toponyms (fig.) linking placenames to administrative unit types (prefectures, sub-prefectures, counties, and so forth) that are identified in the key found in the preface at the bottom right (fig.).

Just north of the Yellow River is the band of white “desert dots” of the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts running from the third to the eighth panel. Surrounding much of the empire is the wave patterned oceans from the Atlantic (top left) to the Pacific (half of panel two on the right) and seas. There are two prominent man-made structures as well. The Great Wall, with its distinctive crenelated wall pattern, which runs between the Yellow River and the Gobi Desert. The other manmade structure shown is the lesser-known Willow Palisade (<em>liutiaobian</em> 柳條邊), which emerges close to where the Great Wall ends and enters the sea and is demarcated by cross-hatched lines. The Willow Palisade is the symbolic barrier protecting the Manchu homeland within which are located the Manchu imperial tombs, the “eastern capital” 東京 or “secondary capital,” Shengjing 盛京 (m. Mukden) and the Imperial hunting grounds.</p> <p>The typology of this map is administrative using specifically the device of an encoded toponym first used in Luo Hongxian’s <em>Guang yutu</em> (see entry 5) for a type of map unique to East Asia. The majority of the eight sheets is taken up by displaying the administrative structure of the Qing empire into an inner and an outer sphere, although the exact boundaries between these two spheres are intentionally ambiguous.</p> <p>The inner sphere is made up of the eighteen provinces of “China proper” and is populated with encoded toponyms (fig.) linking placenames to administrative unit types (prefectures, sub-prefectures, counties, and so forth) that are identified in the key found in the preface at the bottom right (fig.). The use of geometric shapes in association with toponyms and administration visually links places with the people of those places.

Luo Hongxian’s prototype presented the shapes and toponyms differently than on the blue maps: Instead of encircling the toponyms with the shape, the <em>Guang yutu</em> shows the symbols next to the names as can be seen in the <em>Map of Zhejiang Province</em> (<em>Zhejiang yutu</em>, fig.).</p> <p>The encoded toponyms present the micro-scale Ming or Qing Chinese familial relationships and social structure essential in understanding the macro-scale frameworks of the Ming or Qing Chinese realm and its mapping as valued by the state, presenting the hierarchy visually. The atlas visually presented the tax base and therefore income of the state and enabled an easy understanding of administrative and military divisions along with avenues of communication. The integration of text and image as seen here, where a shape was correlated with a place name that was only generally in a relational location is a cartographic typology that is unique to East Asian maps.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup></p> <section class=\"footnotes\"> <ol class=\"footnotes-list\"> <li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Cao, 1995, 36-7. <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p> </li> <li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>In European-style maps, a place name and any administrative indicator are typically next to each other and separated.
