                  During the first decades of the nineteenth century, China was
                  in a moment of transition, grappling with its geopolitical
                  status as both an ancient and modern nation-state. The power
                  of the Qing dynasty had just reached its zenith, establishing
                  a vast territory of political and cultural influence over a
                  multiethnic, geographically dispersed population. Chinese
                  scholars and artists were reconsidering the ideological and
                  practical significance of the imperial realm. Meanwhile,
                  European ideas and goods were arriving in China, bringing both
                  new opportunities and challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was in this moment that two series of large-format maps,
                  one terrestrial and one celestial, were printed in the city of
                  Suzhou. These maps were presented in an extraordinary format,
                  on eight vertical sheets printed in the style of rubbings.
                  Even more strikingly, they were rendered in a rich blue
                  coloring. The pigment Prussian blue had recently begun to be
                  produced in China, and these maps were amongst the first
                  printed objects in East Asia to make use of the
                  colorant—predating the famous use of Prussian blue by Japanese
                  print artists soon after.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The blue maps were more than just visually astonishing. They
                  also captured Chinese ideas about the relationship between
                  terrestrial and celestial space, and still provide insight
                  today into how Chinese scholars and artists conceptualized the
                  world around them. Beautiful and powerful in equal measure,
                  these blue maps capture details of a transitional moment in
                  the history of China—and the wider world. This exhibition
                  considers these two maps in the context of their production,
                  consumption, and functionality, revealing them as unique
                  objects in the global history of mapmaking.

                  A webwork of imaginary lines is all it takes to convert a set
                  of stars that have nothing to do with one another into
                  something recognizable: a dipper, a plow, a swan, an ancient
                  hero. By stitching the points of light in the night sky
                  together into constellations, human culture inserts the loom
                  of interpretation between the universe and our understanding
                  of it. Constellations thus offer a particularly useful
                  starting point for thinking about the troublesome relationship
                  between what actually exists in the world and the cultural
                  systems that intermediate our knowledge of that existence. Are
                  constellations real or imaginary, natural or artificial, out
                  in the world or just in our heads?

                  Of course, they are clearly a bit of both: there aren’t
                  <em>really</em> dippers, or plows, or swans, or ancient heroes
                  in the sky. But those designs aren’t sketched on a blank
                  canvas. The location and arrangement of the stars is actually
                  real, and, at least on the scale of human lifetimes,
                  immutable. What is more, we don’t each make up the
                  constellations from our own individual imaginations alone;
                  they’re handed down through shared cultures, such that we can
                  speak meaningfully with someone who shares our reference
                  system about the Big Dipper as if it really <em>were</em> a
                  thing out in the world and not just a made-up figure in our
                  heads.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A star constellation obviously confounds this distinction
                  between what is known and what is “real,” but the same
                  confusion is also at play in the terrestrial world. We may
                  speak meaningfully about such geographic objects as cities,
                  regions, prefectures, or empires as if the fact of their
                  existence inheres in the shape of the world itself. But upon
                  closer examination, these also turn out to hover somewhere
                  between imagination and reality. There’s only a United States
                  of America or a Guangdong province or any other geographic
                  unit insofar as we collectively agree to recognize such
                  objects—much like dippers and plows in the sky.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unlike star constellations, these terrestrial formations play
                  an instrumental role in politics and power, which is why
                  rulers and administrators have always been so keen to map them
                  and to fix them into place through mechanisms ranging from
                  taxation to census tabulation. In
                  <em>Heaven &amp; Earth,</em> we see this double process of
                  bringing cartographic order to the terrestrial and celestial
                  worlds as it played out in Qing China. In the Chinese
                  cosmographic tradition, heaven and earth were intimately
                  related to one another. The patterns sketched out from the
                  arrangement of the night sky offered practical guidance for
                  how to conceptualize the world on the ground—and also how to
                  govern it. When bureaucrats and functionaries aggregated
                  statistical and administrative information from across the
                  domain of the “<a href="#page-digital-exhibitions-heaven-and-earth-catalogue-7">unified all under heaven</a>” Qing territory, and condensed the information into the
                  figures and symbols of the terrestrial maps on display in
                  <em>Heaven &amp; Earth,</em> they were engaging in a form of
                  knowledge systematization that was more than just
                  circumstantially related to the work of astronomers and
                  cosmographers who traced lines in the skies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The formal connection between the celestial and terrestrial
                  maps on display in <em>Heaven &amp; Earth</em>—their twin
                  derivation from
                  <a href="#page-digital-exhibitions-heaven-and-earth-catalogue-1">stone stele rubbings</a>
                  and their unique use of the
                  <a href="#page-digital-exhibitions-heaven-and-earth-catalogue-3">Prussian blue colorant</a>—offers a prompt to think about how cultures come to make
                  sense of both celestial and terrestrial space by gathering,
                  structuring, and representing knowledge. Whether in dippers in
                  the sky or districts on the ground, plows or provinces, the
                  work of cartographers etches our imaginary systems of order
                  onto the world.

                  In China, during the early decades of the nineteenth century,
                  two series of large format maps, one terrestrial and one
                  celestial, were printed between 1812 and 1826 in the city of
                  Suzhou, one of the economic and intellectual centers of the
                  Chinese empire at the time and throughout much of China’s
                  imperial history. The terrestrial maps, of which most of the
                  ten editions are entitled
                  <em>Geographical Complete Map of the Everlasting Unified Qing
                    Empire</em>

                  selected surrounding regions. The four extant editions of the
                  celestial maps entitled
                  <em>Complete Map of Unified Star Configurations in the
                    Heavens</em>

                  known stars and extensive descriptions of known celestial
                  bodies and their related celestial mechanics. This catalogue
                  essay considers these two maps in the contexts of their
                  interconnected “4 M’s;” that is methods, materials, makers and
                  models; while the catalogue entries provide information about
                  the content of each of the maps and charts included in the
                  exhibition.

                <p>
                  The methods and materials for the production and consumption
                  of the blue maps and charts are unique in cartographic
                  history, not only locally in East Asia but within the larger
                  world.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-essay-fn1" id="page-essay-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  Both maps and charts were produced on eight sheets of Chinese

                  paper in three unique manners; the paper, the printing method
                  and the blue colorant. While the associated mounting and
                  consumption practices are also unique.

                  Xuan paper, made primarily in Anhui and Zhejiang provinces,
                  was principally blue sandalwood (Tara Wingceltis,
                  <em>Ulmus Cavaleriei</em>, known in Chinese as
                  <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">青檀</span>
                  <span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">qingdan</span>), a deciduous tree found throughout China, mixed with
                  differing degrees of rice plant fibers. In the case of the
                  blue maps and charts, a low grade xuan type paper was used,
                  one with less blue sandalwood fibers and more rice plant fiber
                  fill. The paper used was unusual, between a low-cost bamboo
                  paper typical of rubbings (a printing technique) and a
                  high-cost sandalwood paper typical of painting and
                  calligraphy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The blue maps follow closely the aesthetics of a print
                  production known as a rubbing. This printing production
                  methodology began in the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE). The manner
                  of presentation of white characters on a solid color, here
                  blue, should be understood within the context of historical
                  Chinese practices associated with making rubbings from stone
                  stele and ancient bronzes. In China, rubbings were an
                  essential component of long-established epigraphic study and
                  associated collecting practices, as well as specific
                  calligraphic practices. To make a rubbing from an engraved
                  stone stele, slightly moistened paper would be fixed on a
                  prepared, flattened smooth then carved, stone. The moist paper
                  would be manipulated using brushes and pointed sticks,
                  pressing the paper into the recessed areas of the carved
                  stone. An inked (typically in black) dauber (fabric over
                  cotton wadding) would be tamped down onto the paper-covered
                  stone. The ink would adhere to the “raised” paper making the
                  areas of carved away stone appear in white. In this process a
                  positive image is carved on the stone, and a positive image is
                  created on the inked paper. This contrasts to the typical
                  manner of woodblock printing where a negative image is carved
                  into the block, the block is then inked and the paper pressed
                  onto the inked block with the ink transferring to the paper,
                  making for a positive image on the paper. In other words,
                  typical woodblock printing creates a positive image from a
                  negative block.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The blue maps and charts production adhere this process of
                  making rubbings from stone steles, but through printing from
                  woodblocks instead of stone. Like a stone stele, a positive
                  image would be carved into a wooden block that was then used
                  to print in the manner of a rubbing. Historically in China, it
                  is highly unusual to print from woodblocks a positive image
                  from a positive block, especially at this scale. Woodblock
                  printing typically was used to create more easily and quickly
                  multiple similar copies of any given work. Printing in the
                  manner of a rubbing is comparatively very labor intensive and
                  time consuming, creating essentially a unique print each time.
                  Through close visual analysis of the printed paper, the
                  rubbing method of production using woodblocks can easily be
                  seen on the blue maps and charts. As already noted, during the
                  printing process the moistened paper was pressed and stretched
                  into the negative space of the carved woodblock, furthest for
                  the large characters of the title. After printing, when the
                  finished print was to be mounted, the paper was pressed flat
                  and glued to an additional paper backing. The resulting
                  “stretch marks,” formed during the printing process, became
                  folds and creases that can be easily seen when looked for
                  closely on any copy of the blue maps or charts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-essay-fn2" id="page-essay-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>

                  The most striking, and unusual, feature of these maps is of
                  course the blue color that sets them apart from other Chinese
                  maps, and indeed maps from any other part of the world,
                  produced at the time. Scientific spectral analysis of three
                  copies of the terrestrial maps and one copy of a celestial
                  blue map by the Weissman Preservation Center at Harvard
                  University and Microtrace in Elgin Illinois, have confirmed
                  the pigment to be Prussian Blue. Prussian blue, a ferric
                  (iron) hexacyanoferrate, was first synthesized accidentally in
                  Berlin by Johann Jacob Diesbach, a Swiss painter and
                  colormaker, in 1706. Its production is a complex and
                  time-consuming process of acidic additives into a crystalline
                  distillation with resulting varying sized crystals that can be
                  filtered to create different tones of blue (note the two tones
                  of blue used on the terrestrial map, see
                  <a href="#page-digital-exhibitions-heaven-and-earth-catalogue-3">entry 3</a>). The blue maps and charts were produced around the time
                  when Chinese manufacturers learned to make the pigment locally
                  and were less dependent on imports. The discovery of the use
                  of Prussian blue in the case of the blue maps and charts is
                  historically significant as it demonstrates the first
                  large-scale use of Prussian blue for printing in China, and
                  East Asia, in the first decades of the nineteenth century.

                  The blue maps and charts were popular, with ten editions (from
                  forty-six extant copies) for the terrestrial map and four
                  editions (from thirteen extent copies) of the celestial chart
                  identified thus far.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-essay-fn3" id="page-essay-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  The consumption and display techniques of the blue maps and
                  charts hint to their popularity in Japan. The maps and charts
                  were intended to be mounted as sets of multiple (eight)
                  hanging scrolls arranged as a continuous image in a Chinese
                  style known as the panoramic screen (<span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">通景屏</span>
                  <span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">tongjing ping</span>), with no borders or gaps in between the scrolls, and a
                  one-color border (<span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">一色裱</span>
                  <span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">yise biao</span>) in minimal proportions done in paper or brocade below and
                  at the top of each scroll. And, in general, when the printed
                  sheets were mounted in China this was the presentation style.
                  The sheets however were also sold and distributed as unmounted
                  sheets.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-essay-fn4" id="page-essay-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  The maps and charts were soon popular in Japan and arrived as
                  eight unmounted sheets. This is evidenced by the numerous
                  mounting styles fabricated in Japan. The maps and charts can
                  still be found mounted as hanging scrolls, folded screens
                  (<span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">屏風</span>
                  <span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">byōbu</span>, see
                  <a href="#page-digital-exhibitions-heaven-and-earth-catalogue-3">entry 3</a>), sliding doors (<span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">襖</span>
                  <span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">fusuma</span>), and folded sheet maps. The Japanese style mounting of the
                  folded sheet map has two covers, mounted on the back of the
                  map in opposite corners of the map proper, that protect the
                  map when folded. In the case of the hanging scroll style
                  (original Chinese style) in Japan, a two-color mount style
                  (<span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">二色裱</span>
                  <span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">erse biao</span>, and different from the Chinese style) using two separate
                  border colors was used, the preferred style in Japan.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-essay-fn5" id="page-essay-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  The number of still extent blue maps and charts mounted in
                  Japanese styles attests to their popularity in Japan.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Confirmation that the maps were intended to be mounted as
                  hanging scrolls, can be found in the title slips extant on
                  many prints of the terrestrial maps (see
                  <a href="#page-digital-exhibitions-heaven-and-earth-catalogue-3">entry 3</a>). These title slips were printed vertically and stacked on
                  the far-right exterior edge of the first sheet for most
                  editions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-essay-fn6" id="page-essay-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  The map’s title, in an abbreviated form (<span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">Da Qing yitong dili quantu</span>), is repeated eight times in individual rectangular framed
                  boxes. In addition, these eight title slips are numbered in
                  the bottom right corner of each slip, from top to bottom, one
                  to eight. Typically, title slips were a small blank sheet of
                  paper added during the mounting process to the exterior of the
                  rolled hanging scroll (hanging scrolls are rolled when
                  stored). After application to the scroll by the mount maker a
                  title would be written on the slip. In other words, the title
                  slips were typically produced by the mount maker, entirely
                  separately from the printing process, and attached to the
                  scroll when the work was mounted onto the backing paper that
                  helps protect the original work. On the blue maps, however,
                  these title slips were incorporated into the original printing
                  process, even though they were not, technically, part of the
                  map proper. It is quite unusual that title slips were part of
                  the original printed work, to be removed by the mount maker.
                  Mount makers would typically never alter the original work in
                  any way. The title slips imply that the printer and mount
                  maker, typically unrelated craftsmen, collaborated, or at
                  least that the production team seriously considered the mount
                  maker as part of the project. The intentional inclusion of
                  these eight slips indicates that the maps were to be mounted
                  as hanging scrolls, with the title slips cut off, separated
                  and placed outside the mount as labels on the exterior of the
                  rolled scrolls; again a highly unusual production model. What
                  is interesting to note is that the printed sheets were
                  distributed to Japan as loose sheets, where mounters kept the
                  title slips attached when mounting the maps (see
                  <a href="#page-digital-exhibitions-heaven-and-earth-catalogue-3">entry 3</a>). As demonstrated above, the production of the blue maps and
                  charts are unusual in historical (Chinese, East Asian and
                  World) mapmaking through using a low-grade Xuan paper and
                  unique in three ways, rubbing printing method, title slips,
                  and in use of Prussian blue.

                  Suzhou, one of the economic and intellectual centers of the
                  Qing empire at the time of the blue maps and charts production
                  and throughout much of China’s imperial history, appears on
                  all signed editions, of thus far unidentified persons and or
                  their studios, of the terrestrial map as a place of
                  production. Only the last edition of the blue celestial chart
                  dated to the fifth month of 1826 is signed by a known
                  personage, Qian Yong (1759–1844). Qian Yong was a poet and
                  author as well as an accomplished calligrapher of the
                  so-called stone stele (<span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">碑</span>
                  <span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">bei</span>
                  ) school of calligraphy, traveling extensively throughout
                  China collecting samples of rubbings from stone stele. That a
                  calligrapher was part of the design of the blue celestial maps
                  should come as no surprise. All celestial editions can be
                  divided by calligraphic types into three different styles,
                  unusual for a single object. The first section is dedicated to
                  the large eight-character title in seal script (<span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">篆書</span>
                  <span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">zhuanshu</span>), while the last section contains an inscription in clerical
                  script (<span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">隸書</span>
                  <span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">lishu</span>), giving some general information about the chart, which
                  differs between the 1822 and the 1826 editions. The main text
                  written in standard script (<span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">楷書</span>
                  <span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">kaishu</span>) on six sheets, is structured along sixteen section heads
                  demarcated by white boxes with blue character titles. That the
                  celestial map was designed with multiple styles of calligraphy
                  suggests a calligrapher, like Qian Yong, designed the text
                  layout and that he participated in the creation of all four
                  editions.

                  In late imperial China, the collecting, making of rubbings and
                  copying of calligraphy found on ancient stone stele
                  (<em>bei</em>), and the rubbings of calligraphy on ancient
                  bronze vessels or from copy books of calligraphy (<span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">帖</span>
                  <span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">tie</span>) schools of calligraphy were both popular. These two schools
                  of collecting and related collecting practices originated in
                  the seventeenth century amongst groups of scholars, artists,
                  collectors, and calligraphers that formed social groups around
                  literary, collecting, and artistic practices of common
                  interest, often sharing and collaborating with each other.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-essay-fn7" id="page-essay-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  These types of scholarly groups were in a period of revival in
                  the early nineteenth century with well-known
                  scholar/painter/calligrapher/rubbings collectors including Yi
                  Bingshou
                  <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">伊秉綬</span>
                  (1755–1815) who wrote sixteen quatrain poems on famous model
                  rubbings. Qian Yong was likely active in similar groups and
                  discussions among such groups which probably contributed to
                  the creation of the blue maps and charts. No doubt the
                  proximity to the two 1247 map steles, the <em>Dili tu</em> and
                  <em>tianwen tu</em> (see entries
                  <a href="#page-digital-exhibitions-heaven-and-earth-catalogue-1">1</a>
                  and
                  <a href="#page-digital-exhibitions-heaven-and-earth-catalogue-2">2</a>), themselves in the Confucian temple in Suzhou also helps
                  explain Qian Yong’s interest in the blue map and chart
                  project, as he was an avid stele-school follower himself.

                <h2>Models</h2>
                <p>
                  This exhibition especially emphasizes three different
                  historical models for the blue maps and charts; a particular
                  typology (unique to East Asia) of administrative mapping, the
                  Huang family legacy and the cosmological/astrological pairing
                  of a terrestrial map and celestial chart.
                </p>
                <h2>Administrative Mapping</h2>
                <p>
                  Luo Hongxian’s (1504-64)
                  <em>Enlarged Territorial Atlas</em> (<em>Guangyu tu</em>, see
                  catalogue entry 5) dated 1566, includes maps of the eighteen
                  provinces of late Ming dynasty (1368-1644) China. Luo created
                  twenty-four standardized symbols, found in a key, associated
                  with census figures, military information and tributary
                  reports and placed them next to place names, in the earliest
                  use in China of an “encoded toponym.” The use of geometric
                  shapes in association with toponyms and administration is a
                  characteristic of a typology of Chinese mapmaking that
                  visually links places with the people of those places
                  beginning in the late Ming dynasty. The blue terrestrial maps
                  use a key and a conceptually similar system, except the
                  toponyms were placed inside the encoded shapes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By encoding administrative units with a geometric shape and
                  thus visually prioritizing administration over geography, the
                  people living in each administrative unit become important, as
                  does the relationship of each toponym with the surrounding
                  ones in an administrative hierarchy of the entire empire (by
                  mapping placenames that are presented relationally as opposed
                  to geometrically/to scale to each other). Each toponym is
                  encoded through a shape that ties it immediately to the
                  administration and a social structure. If we consider these
                  encoded toponyms as presenting a specifically Chinese paradigm
                  of a socio-political order that has a familial framework, then
                  the entire terrestrial blue map can be understood as
                  presenting the paradigm of an idealized order that is the Qing
                  empire. Within a specifically Chinese context this type of
                  socio-political order with a familial framework was proposed
                  and implemented by Confucius (551-479 BCE) and his followers
                  as a method to promote peace and stability on micro and macro
                  scales. That is not to say that these maps are explicitly
                  Confucian in any way but that the blue terrestrial maps
                  present similar paradigms. These maps visualize the
                  correlative relationships of a Chinese cosmological order
                  found between the toponyms, geography, social structures, and
                  the people that inhabit those spaces. The micro-scale familial
                  relationships and social structure essential in understanding
                  the macro-scale frameworks of the Qing realm and its mapping
                  are valued and these maps precisely present the hierarchy
                  visually.
                </p>
                <h2>Huang family legacy</h2>
                <p>
                  In the preface of the blue terrestrial map the authors credit
                  as their principal source Huang Qianren’s
                  <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">黃千人</span>
                  (1694–1771), a student at the National University and later a
                  low-ranking official, 1767 map titled
                  <em>Complete map of the everlasting Great Qing unified all
                    under heaven</em>
                  (<em>Da Qing wannian yitong tianxia quantu)</em>. Huang in
                  turn, on his 1767 map, credits his grandfather’s, Huang Zongxi
                  <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">黃宗羲</span>
                  (1610–1695), map of the early Qing empire (<em>Yudi quantu)</em>
                  dated to 1673. The general layout and administrative emphasis,
                  in particular the use of encoded toponyms, of the blue
                  terrestrial maps thus lay in the legacy of the Huang family’s
                  map making.

                  Two other maps in the exhibition claim the same lineage to the
                  Huang family. The large lower map of Ma Junliang’s (jinshi
                  1761)
                  <em>Capital Edition of the complete map (based on)
                    astronomy</em>
                  (<span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">京板天文全圖</span>
                  <span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">Jingban tianwen quantu</span>), from circa 1795, also claims to be based on Huang
                  Qianren’s 1767 map (see catalogue entry 6). And Zhu Xiling’s
                  <em>Complete all under heaven map of the everlasting unified
                    Qing empire</em>
                  (<span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">大清一統天下全圖</span>
                  <span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">Daqing yitong tianxia quantu</span>), dated to 1818, follows the same lineage (see catalogue
                  entry 7).

                <h2>Cosmological/Astrological Pairing</h2>
                <p>
                  The terrestrial maps conceptually and visually prioritize
                  multiple “inner” and “outer” historical administrative
                  frameworks that participate in Chinese familial practices set
                  within a standardized infrastructure of geophysical and
                  manmade attributes (see
                  <a href="#page-digital-exhibitions-heaven-and-earth-catalogue-3">entry 3</a>). The celestial charts present a planisphere of stars and
                  constellations in conjunction with geographic and planetary
                  correlations while surrounding texts present important
                  celestial mechanics (see
                  <a href="#page-digital-exhibitions-heaven-and-earth-catalogue-4">entry 4</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although the two maps can function separately, and each emerge
                  from their own unique historical trajectories they should be
                  understood conceptually as part of a larger cosmological
                  framework. Modern analytic examinations typically ignore the
                  combination of celestial and terrestrial mapping, preferring
                  to polarize and separate the two map types (the terrestrial is
                  considered geographic and historical while the celestial is
                  scientific). This exhibition and related catalogue rectifies
                  this trend. These maps were meant to be considered together in
                  relationships and correlations participating in a long
                  historical tradition established since at least the stone
                  steles <em>Dili tu</em> (<em>Geographical Map</em>) and the
                  <em>Tianwen tu</em> <em>(Celestial Chart</em>) carved in 1247
                  (See catalogue entries 1 and 2). This is confirmed in the
                  epilogue of the 1822 edition of the celestial chart where both
                  of the 1247 map and chart are specifically cited. The titles
                  of the blue map and chart provide further confirmation. First,
                  the terrestrial map specifically used the term
                  <em>dili</em> (terrestrial) in the title at a time when the
                  preference was to use the term <em>tianxia</em> (all under
                  heaven, see
                  <a href="#page-digital-exhibitions-heaven-and-earth-catalogue-7">entry 7</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-essay-fn8" id="page-essay-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  And second, both titles use the binomial terms
                  <em>yitong</em> (unified) and <em>quantu</em> (complete map or
                  chart) as a connecting linkage. While the use of these
                  binomial terms is not unusual for the terrestrial map they are
                  highly unusual for a celestial chart confirming the two terms
                  are meant to connect and couple the blue map and chart and
                  thus to function in the same manner as the 1247 map and chart.
                  Conceptually functioning like the thirteenth century steles,
                  the blue maps (although greatly expanded, updated, and
                  differing completely in their materiality) show the territory
                  and administrative structure of Qing China with some
                  surrounding regions as combined with a planisphere of all the
                  known stars.

                        Another example found at Waseda University mounted the

                        That these title slips were meant to be cut off is made
                        especially evident in the case of the editions with the
                        title slips placed on the eighth scroll, as they would
                        have been displayed in the middle of the map if not cut

                      <p>
                        A pair of engravings on stone steles, or vertical slabs,
                        formed the precedents for the blue maps and charts.
                        These steles were first created in the thirteenth

                        The blue maps and charts reference and were inspired by
                        a pair of maps engraved on steles located, then and
                        still today, in the Confucian Temple (Wenmiao
                        <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">文廟</span>) in the city of Suzhou as confirmed in the epilogue of
                        the 1822 blue celestial chart. One of them is a
                        terrestrial map titled Dili tu

                        titled Tianwen tu
                        <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">天文圖</span>. The scholar Huang Shang
                        <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">黃裳</span>
                        (1146–1194), active in the Southern Song (1126–1279)
                        court, created both these maps in the 1190s, and
                        subsequently Wang Zhiyuan
                        <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">王致远</span>
                        (1193–1257) had them engraved on stone in 1247 and since
                        that time rubbings on paper have been made of these
                        maps. Huang’s two maps were first meant to be combined
                        to present ideal cosmological models for the young
                        Prince Jia, the future Ningzong

                        Emperor (r. 1194-1224) on good governance. The viewer
                        was meant to visualize that good governance through the
                        correlative properties between heaven and earth found on
                        the micro scale within each of the two maps and on the
                        macro scale in consideration of the entire empire with
                        the two maps combined. Over 600 years after the creation
                        of the steles, Chinese scholars in the city of Suzhou
                        decided to create their own, albeit in blue, updated
                        images of heaven and earth so closely linked to their
                        own city.

                        The dili tu illustrates 368 prefectures, 623 military
                        bases, 73 rivers, 27 lakes, 180 mountains and 24 passes.
                        The year that Huang Shang presented this map to the
                        court, the Guangzong Emperor (r. 1190-94) abdicated the
                        throne to his younger brother the Ningzong Emperor (r.
                        1194-1224). The map displays a unified China before the
                        creation of the Southern Song dynasty (1127-1279), a
                        period before the Song imperial family lost north China
                        to the Jurchen-led Jin Dynasty, as an aspiration to a
                        return to the earlier idealized time of the Northern
                        Song dynasty. The dili tu was a deliberate piece of
                        statecraft meant to serve as a moralistic exemplar of
                        the hoped for outcome of good government for the young
                        Ningzong emperor.

                        The second of the two rubbings is a
                        <em>Celestial Chart</em> (<span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">天文圖</span>&nbsp;<span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">Tianwen tu</span>), which shows a planisphere, or projection of the
                        night sky. Here, each constellation is named and the
                        curved course of the Milky Way is clearly marked. The
                        grouping and naming of stars in China differs from the
                        Greco-Roman constellation names that are more familiar
                        in the West. This chart also uses a traditional Chinese
                        equatorial-polar projection. Three “rings” (<span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">带</span>
                        <span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">dai</span>) mark the horizon (outer circle), the celestial
                        equator (the middle concentric circle), and the ecliptic
                        (the middle offset circle). The innermost circle
                        represents the line of constant visibility, enclosing
                        constellations which are always visible in the Northern
                        Hemisphere.&nbsp;Amongst these constellations is the Big
                        Dipper, known as the Seven Stars or Northern Plow in
                        Chinese.

                      <p>
                        The main text of the <em>Celestial Chart</em> discusses
                        important celestial bodies and their configurations
                        (dimensions and shapes). It also provides observations
                        like relative movements, cycles and durations,
                        relationships to terrestrial phenomena (like the four
                        seasons), and irregular occurrences (eclipses or
                        supernovas). Finally, the chart describes how the
                        fortunes of the people who govern any terrestrial
                        location can be understood by observing that location’s
                        corresponding celestial manifestations.

                        The epilogue of the 1822 edition of the blue celestial
                        chart specifically references the 1247
                        <em>dili tu</em> and <em>tianwen tu</em> as models of
                        emulation for the blue maps and charts confirming the
                        source. The main text body of the
                        <em>tianwen tu</em> discusses all important celestial
                        bodies and their configurations (dimensions and shapes),
                        relative movements, cycles and durations, relationships

                        In the planispere of the <em>tianwen tu</em>, each
                        constellation is named, the curved course of the Milky
                        Way is clearly demarcated and although the text states
                        there are 1565 stars only 1440 stars are shown (fig.
                        ).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-catalogue-2-fn1" id="page-catalogue-2-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                        There are three “circles” or “rings” (<em>dai</em>
                        <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">带</span>) required to plot the relative positions of celestial
                        bodies, the horizon, the (celestial) equator and the
                        ecliptic (apparent path of the sun against the stars).
                        The <em>tianwen tu</em> uses a traditional Chinese
                        equatorial-polar projection, the inner circle is the
                        line of constant visibility, the equator (<em>chidao</em>
                        <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">赤道</span>, literally “red road”) is shown as an offset circle
                        within the planisphere while the ecliptic (<em>huangdao</em>
                        <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">黃道</span>) is the other offset circle intersecting it also
                        within the planisphere, both are labeled as such. The
                        radial lines from the center demarcate the twenty-eight
                        lunar mansions (<em>xiu</em>
                        <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">宿</span>), each labeled by a character with a ring around

                        indicates numerous directional signifiers such as the
                        widths of the twenty-eight lunar mansions, the twelve
                        terrestrial branches (<em>chen</em>

                        This type of astrological consideration is found in many
                        cultures from ancient times until today. The example
                        from the <em>tianwen tu</em> confirms that conceptually
                        there is understood to be a direct correlation between
                        the celestial and terrestrial with, localized or grouped
                        according to each lunar mansion as found on the outer
                        ring, spatial coordinates for both presented side by
                        side in the same pie-section division. There is an
                        accepted and understood relational co-existence and
                        correlation between events observed in the sky and
                        events on earth.

                      <p>
                        This is an administrative map of the Qing empire with
                        place names, or toponyms, shown embedded in shape
                        symbols. The majority of the map consists of these
                        encoded toponyms, which present the inner sphere of the
                        18 provinces that made up “China proper.” Meanwhile, the
                        outer sphere of the map, made up of a surrounding ring
                        of text blocks with no borders of any kind, indicates
                        neighboring political entities that had official
                        relations with the Qing empire, including Russia, India,
                        Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, and Korea. The encoding and
                        text blocks enable a visual snapshot of the entire
                        administrative, communications, and taxation systems of
                        the Qing empire, as well as its orientation towards
                        other political powers in the region.

                        Several geophysical attributes help to orient the
                        viewer. The two vivid white lines trace out the Yellow
                        River (north) and the Yangzi River (south). Just north
                        of the Yellow River is a stippled band of white dots
                        that marks the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts. Wave
                        patterns indicate oceans, including the Atlantic (top
                        left) and Pacific (occupying much of the second panel
                        from right). There are two prominent human-made
                        structures. The Great Wall, with its distinctive
                        crenellated wall pattern, runs between the Yellow River
                        and the Gobi Desert. The Willow Palisade, which emerges
                        close to where the Great Wall meets the sea, is shown
                        with cross-hatched lines.

                        Several Geophysical attributes can be easily
                        distinguished in the overall visual presentation of this
                        map of the Qing empire; such as the two vivid white
                        lines of the Yellow River (north) and the Yangzi River
                        (south) which divide the empire east and west. Just
                        north of the Yellow River is the band of white “desert
                        dots” of the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts running from
                        the third to the eighth panel. Surrounding much of the
                        empire is the wave patterned oceans from the Atlantic
                        (top left) to the Pacific (half of panel two on the
                        right) and seas. There are two prominent man-made
                        structures as well. The Great Wall, with its distinctive
                        crenelated wall pattern, which runs between the Yellow
                        River and the Gobi Desert. The other manmade structure
                        shown is the lesser-known Willow Palisade (<em>liutiaobian</em>
                        <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">柳條邊</span>), which emerges close to where the Great Wall ends and
                        enters the sea and is demarcated by cross-hatched lines.
                        The Willow Palisade is the symbolic barrier protecting
                        the Manchu homeland within which are located the Manchu
                        imperial tombs, the “eastern capital”

                        The typology of this map is administrative using
                        specifically the device of an encoded toponym first used
                        in Luo Hongxian’s <em>Guang yutu</em> (see entry 5) for
                        a type of map unique to East Asia. The majority of the
                        eight sheets is taken up by displaying the
                        administrative structure of the Qing empire into an
                        inner and an outer sphere, although the exact boundaries
                        between these two spheres are intentionally ambiguous.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The inner sphere is made up of the eighteen provinces of
                        “China proper” and is populated with encoded toponyms
                        (fig.) linking placenames to administrative unit types
                        (prefectures, sub-prefectures, counties, and so forth)
                        that are identified in the key found in the preface at
                        the bottom right (fig.). The use of geometric shapes in
                        association with toponyms and administration visually
                        links places with the people of those places. By
                        encoding administrative units with a geographic shape
                        and thus visually prioritizing administration over
                        territory, the people living in each administrative unit
                        become important, as does the relation of each toponym
                        with the surrounding ones in an administrative hierarchy
                        of the entire empire. The administrative coding visually
                        and easily enables a snapshot of the entire
                        administrative, communications, and tax systems.

                      <p>
                        While the inner portion of the maps focuses on the
                        administrative framework of the Qing empire by
                        presenting encoded toponyms, the outer sphere is made up
                        of a surrounding ring of text blocks (labeled fig.),
                        with no borders of any kind, associated with states that
                        have official relations, and geographic proximity, with
                        the Qing empire and are described on the map as places
                        that “bring tribute” (<em>chaogong</em>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-catalogue-3-fn1" id="page-catalogue-3-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                        These include a range of non-Qing entities, including
                        Russia, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, and Korea, as
                        visually unbounded spaces. These outer entities, as text
                        blocks, also require administrative attention, albeit
                        from separate governmental agencies. The outer sphere
                        entities were generally governed by ranked local
                        administrators in specific cities that reported to the
                        Ministry of Rites and included Annam (today’s Vietnam),
                        Burma (today’s Myanmar), the Ryukyu (Okinawa) Islands,
                        and Siam (today’s Thailand). Russia (fig.), also
                        presented as part of this outer sphere, was administered
                        by the Board for Governing Outer Territories (ch.

                        Joseon Korea (fig.) was given special privilege,
                        communicating with no intermediary body but directly
                        with the Ministry of Rites in Beijing.

                        The maps also present an ambiguous third sphere, between
                        the inner and outer. This in-between sphere is made up
                        of the regions conquered and integrated into the Qing
                        empire in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries:
                        Mongolia, Tibet, Xinjiang, and Taiwan. On the blue maps,
                        these regions include both administrative units encoded
                        by shape as well as short annotations similar to those
                        for the non-Qing regions, taking on elements from both
                        the inner and outer spheres.

                        Geographical and topographical elements like oceans,
                        mountains and rivers are embedded throughout the entire
                        map, linking the inner, outer, and in-between spheres in
                        a grand vision of Qing space. Frontiers were not sites
                        of separation but sites of relationality acting as
                        bridges connecting people, things and ideas. By using
                        toponyms that were encoded to reflect the humanity
                        (administrative bodies) of all places in the empire
                        operating within a Chinese familial framework, this type
                        of map presents, visually, systems for maintaining all
                        the empire’s relationships, internal and external or
                        inner and outer. It can be understood to conceptually
                        manifest an idealized and harmonious empire that
                        emphasized an historically stable core of eighteen
                        ethnically Han provinces surrounded by other related
                        non-Han entities. The celestial blue maps will introduce
                        another component of an intended larger cosmological
                        order that ultimately unites heaven and earth.

                              The term “bring tribute” reflects official
                              relations and affiliations between the Qing empire
                              and the “tribute bringing” countries, using a
                              vocabulary from the point of view of the Chinese
                              state. As the Qing state preferred to segment and
                              localize its external relations through ranked
                              local administrators to monitor foreign entities
                              and provide a direct and trusted conduit for
                              intelligence to Beijing from the frontier, the
                              Ministry of Rites regulated that officials from
                              each country had to use a specific city to enter
                              the Qing empire.

                        In this blue celestial chart, printed in 1826, most of
                        the body text is identical to that on the

                        constellations have been updated with additional stars
                        discovered by Europeans. These discoveries, made
                        possible by the invention of the telescope, were
                        introduced into Chinese star charts by Europeans working
                        in the Chinese court from the seventeenth century
                        onwards. The curved course of the Milky Way (<span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">天河</span>
                        <span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">tianhe</span>, or “heavenly river”) is clearly indicated.

                      <p>
                        The outer ring of the blue chart marks the horizon, and
                        directly connects the celestial realm with the
                        terrestrial one. It reads counterclockwise, just as the
                        night sky rotates when seen by an observer on earth, and
                        includes numerous directional signifiers. For example,
                        the section at the bottom of the chart with the “first”
                        branch (<span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">子</span>
                        <span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">zi</span>) is in the

                        sets of constellations are tied to the ancient twelve
                        provinces of China. The horizon band provides
                        astrological cues and emphasizes the intended
                        functionality of correlations and correspondences
                        between heaven and earth.

                        The blue
                        <em>Huntian yitong xingxiang quantu</em> (Complete chart
                        of unified star configurations in the heavens) are star
                        charts with related celestial information. The first
                        (far right) sheet presents the title in seal script
                        while the last (far left) sheet presents an epilogue, a
                        date and a signature of the maker in clerical script.
                        The remaining six sheets present a planisphere and
                        related celestial information using standard script.

                      <p>
                        The main text body on the 1826 editions of the blue
                        charts essentially copies the text of the 1247
                        <em>Tianwen tu</em> stele (see entry 2). The sections
                        are clearly indicated by headings, presenting the
                        Chinese characters in blue on white, while the primary
                        text is white on a blue field; the same aesthetic found
                        on the terrestrial maps.

                      <p>
                        The central and most eye-catching part of this chart is
                        the planisphere. On it, each constellation is named and
                        the curved course of the Milky Way (labeled as Tianhe
                        <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">天河</span>, “heavenly river”) is clearly demarcated.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-catalogue-4-fn1" id="page-catalogue-4-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                        The outer ring (horizon) of the blue charts provides
                        pointers to understanding the night sky and even more
                        directly connects the celestial realm with the
                        terrestrial one. It reads counterclockwise (in the
                        manner of the rotation of the night sky to an observer
                        on earth) and indicates numerous directional signifiers,
                        as also found on the 1247 <em>Tianwen tu</em>. The chart
                        is printed in such a way that the characters always face
                        outward. When the planisphere is “rotated” (conceptually
                        as the physical object is too large) to the time of
                        observation the characters at the “bottom” are always
                        right side up and in a position to be easily read. They
                        are rather technical and require an astronomical and
                        astrological knowledge base. The directional signifiers
                        include the relative widths of the twenty-eight lunar
                        mansions, the twelve terrestrial branches (<em>chen</em>
                        <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">辰</span>), twelve Jupiter positions or zodiacal positions (<em>ci</em>
                        <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">次</span>), and the corresponding states and provinces under the
                        astral allocation system (<em>fenye</em>
                        <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">分野</span>, also known as field-allocation). This division into
                        twelve parts under the astral allocation system had been
                        in astrological use since the late fifth century BCE and
                        correlates celestial and terrestrial space.

                        For example, the section at the bottom of the chart with
                        the “first” branch <em>zi</em>
                        <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">子</span>
                        (north), is in the <em>yuanxiao</em>

                        position, corresponding to the ancient state of Qi
                        <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">齊</span>
                        and Qingzhou province
                        <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">青州</span>
                        (today’s Shandong province, see entry 2). This horizon
                        band of the blue charts provides astrological cues and
                        emphasizes the intended functionality of correlations
                        and correspondences between heaven and earth that are to
                        be interpreted by man. The blue charts, like the
                        <em>Tianwen tu</em>, clearly indicate that specific sets
                        of constellations are tied to the ancient twelve
                        provinces of China. A direct correlation between heaven
                        and earth is thus embedded into the chart itself. This
                        conceptual consideration can be further applied to the
                        overall framing of the combined two blue map and chart,
                        which are created as a pair, terrestrial and celestial,
                        and modeled on the 1247 <em>dili tu</em> and
                        <em>tianwen tu</em>, maintaining the correlative
                        properties between heaven and earth, within a Chinese
                        cultural sphere.

                        epilogue that simply states the purpose of the map: To
                        explain heavenly bodies. It is dated May 1826 (sixth
                        year of Daoguang reign, fourth month
                        <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">道光六年歲在丙戊孟夏之月</span>) and signed by Qian Yong from Jingui
                        <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">金匱梅溪钱泳書</span>. Of all the ten editions of the terrestrial map and
                        the four editions of the celestial map this is the final
                        and only edition that has a signature of a known maker
                        for the blue maps and charts. Qian Yong was a poet and
                        author as well as an accomplished calligrapher of the
                        so-called stone stele (<em>bei</em>
                        <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">碑</span>) school of calligraphy, traveling extensively around
                        China collecting samples of rubbings from stele. That
                        the celestial chart was designed with multiple styles of
                        calligraphy suggests a calligrapher, like Qian Yong,
                        designed the text layout and that he participated in the
                        creation of all four editions. That the production of
                        all the maps and charts are done in the manner of
                        rubbings suggests a collector of rubbings suggested this
                        method. And that the two stele that the blue map and
                        chart are modeled after were, and still are, found in
                        the city of Suzhou and the blue maps and charts were all
                        produced in the city of Suzhou suggests that Qian Yong
                        participated in all phases of production.

                        In the Ming and Qing dynasties, administrators were
                        responsible for supplying statistics about their areas

                        of encircling the toponyms with a shape, as on the blue
                        maps, the&nbsp;<em>Enlarged Territorial Atlas</em>&nbsp;shows
                        symbols in black next to toponyms. This visual style can
                        be seen in the&nbsp;<em>Map of Zhejiang Province</em>&nbsp;(<span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">浙江輿圖</span>&nbsp;<span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">Zhejiang yutu</span>). The atlas visually enabled an easy understanding of
                        administrative and military divisions along with avenues
                        of communication.&nbsp;Encoded toponyms were arrayed on the

                        another, but not in a precise geographic arrangement.

                        information that included administrative systems,

                        While the grid is absent from the blue maps and only
                        alluded to in the introduction, keying administrative
                        units to specific shapes can be found both on the
                        <em>Guang yutu</em> and the blue maps. Luo Hongxian’s
                        prototype presented the shapes and toponyms differently
                        than on the blue maps: Instead of encircling the
                        toponyms with the shape, the <em>Guang yutu</em> shows
                        the symbols next to the names as can be seen in the
                        <em>Map of Zhejiang Province</em> (<em>Zhejiang yutu</em>, fig.).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The encoded toponyms present the micro-scale Ming or
                        Qing Chinese familial relationships and social structure
                        essential in understanding the macro-scale frameworks of
                        the Ming or Qing Chinese realm and its mapping as valued
                        by the state, presenting the hierarchy visually. The
                        atlas visually presented the tax base and therefore
                        income of the state and enabled an easy understanding of
                        administrative and military divisions along with avenues
                        of communication. The integration of text and image as
                        seen here, where a shape was correlated with a place
                        name that was only generally in a relational location is
                        a cartographic typology that is unique to East Asian
                        maps.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-catalogue-5-fn2" id="page-catalogue-5-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>

                              In European-style maps, a place name and any
                              administrative indicator are typically next to
                              each other and separated. The distinction where
                              European cartography tended to polarize
                              subjectivity and objectivity while East Asian
                              cartography united it, is well demonstrated in
                              this map. In addition, scientific and geometric
                              “accuracy” was not an important factor in the
                              making of these maps. And the administrative
                              accuracy is higher than anything achieved in
                              European maps of the period.

                        European influences and the pressure of foreign power on
                        the Chinese court. The three maps together, bringing the

                        Ma Junliang (imperial graduate degree [<em>jinshi</em>]
                        1761) was an official cartographer working for the
                        imperial court in Beijing in the late eighteenth
                        century. Ma created the woodblock printed
                        <em>Capital edition of the complete map [based on]
                          astronomy</em>
                        (<em>Jingban tianwen quantu</em>) during the mid-1790s.
                        This colored copy is unusual in that most extant copies
                        are simply black ink on paper.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-catalogue-6-fn1" id="page-catalogue-6-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                        This map was created at a time when cartographers in
                        China, like Ma and Zhuang Tingfu (1728-1800), were
                        reexamining historical mapping practices.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-catalogue-6-fn2" id="page-catalogue-6-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                        They both participate in a type of mapmaking that
                        involves using the <em>gujin</em> paradigm. The binomial
                        term, <em>gujin</em>
                        <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">古今</span>
                        means something like “past and present” and is made up
                        of the character <em>gu</em> meaning an unspecified
                        there-then and <em>jin</em> meaning the here-now. The
                        two terms knit together—<em>gujin</em>—suggest a
                        conversation between temporalities, whereby Chinese
                        scholars actively joined historical events of the past
                        to help define the present through a process of
                        deliberate recovery and application.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-catalogue-6-fn3" id="page-catalogue-6-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                        Conceptually this paradigm is also found in the blue
                        maps and charts that specifically model and reference
                        the 1247 map and chart.

                        Here, Ma Junliang juxtaposes three different maps
                        created during two different historical periods. The
                        small map at the top right is the
                        <em>Complete geographic map of mountains and streams</em>
                        <em>(Shanhai yudi quantu</em>), from Wang Qi’s
                        (1529-1612), illustrated
                        <em>Sancai tuhui</em> encyclopedia of 1609. The map in
                        the top left is the “eastern hemisphere” map from Chen
                        Lunjiong’s (fl. 1703-1730)&nbsp;<em>Record of things heard and seen in the maritime
                          countries</em>
                        (<em>Haiguo wenjian lu</em>), completed in 1730 and

                        Chen’s simple schematic terraqueous map is however a
                        direct descendent, albeit only showing the eastern

                        represent late Ming period mapmaking presentation

                        The <em>jin</em> of the paradigm is represented by the
                        large map below. It belongs to the Huang family lineage
                        of Qing court map makers and derives from Huang Zongxi’s
                        (1610-95) 1673 <em>Map of China</em> (<em>Yudi quantu</em>), amended by his grandson Huang Qianren (1694–1771) in
                        1767 (see entries essay, entries 3 and 7).

                        The date is important, for just a few years before, in
                        1759, Manchuria, Mongolia, Tibet, and Chinese Turkistan
                        were finally brought under Qing rule. Emperor Qianlong
                        (r. 1736-96) appointed officials from the Manchu
                        administrative units called banners, as well as local
                        political figures, to supply statistics about their
                        administrative districts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-catalogue-6-fn6" id="page-catalogue-6-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                        That information was compiled by Huang Qianren and
                        published as a multi-colored woodblock-printed map in
                        1767 with the title
                        <em>All under heaven map of the everlasting unified Qing
                          empire</em>
                        (<em>Daqing wannian yitong tianxia quantu</em>), the
                        same map that was a source for the blue terrestrial map.
                        Ma presents his version of the Huang family map on the
                        <em>Jingban tianwen quantu</em> as a contemporary
                        Chinese map of the Qing empire. Ma’s map connected the
                        “then and now” visually, looking to the past to find
                        accessible historical maps that matched and helped
                        explain the changed circumstances of the present.
                        European mapping practices introduced in the early
                        seventeenth century, were again in the 1790s being
                        introduced when a European presence was pressing again
                        in the Chinese court. The three maps together, two from
                        the late Ming that were being revisited, are juxtaposed
                        with an indigenous Chinese map at a time when Qing China
                        was coming to terms with a largely unknown and
                        potentially threatening world.

                        printed at least three editions of this map, all as
                        multicolored woodblock prints. Like the blue terrestrial
                        map, this map is based on

                        source. This map, like the blue terrestrial map,
                        emphasized the administration of the Qing empire. There
                        is a key in the bottom right corner, similar to the key
                        found on the blue maps, that defines the meaning of the

                        In comparison to the blue terrestrial map, Zhu’s map
                        differs in several interesting points. The most obvious
                        is the scale. The map vertically compresses the same
                        geographical area into a tall thin format about a third
                        the width of the blue map. The next obvious difference
                        is in coloration. All extant prints of Zhu’s map use
                        multiple colors, both to define the 18 provinces of
                        “China proper” as well as to shade natural elements like
                        the oceans, deserts, and mountains. Below the title are
                        lists of distances from each province to the capital
                        (not found on the blue map). This map also presents
                        Beijing differently, as much larger and more detailed,
                        including a depiction of the Forbidden City, with its
                        gates labeled on the city’s inner and outer sections.

                        the width to almost three times that of the 1818 map.
                        The next obvious difference is in coloration. All extent
                        prints of Zhu’s map use multiple colors, primarily in
                        the 18 provinces of “China proper” and the region
                        surrounded by the Willow Palisade. Natural elements like
                        the oceans, deserts, and mountains are colored as well.
                        The use of multiple colors, like printing a map all in
                        blue, makes for a striking presentation visually
                        enhancing each map.

                      <p>
                        Below the title, are lists of distances from each
                        province to the capital (absent on the blue terrestrial
                        maps). Furthermore, the 1818 map presents the capital,
                        Beijing as much larger and more detailed, including a
                        depiction of the forbidden city, with all gates labeled
                        on the inner and outer sections of the capital (fig. ).

                      <p>
                        This map, like the blue terrestrial map, emphasized the
                        administration of the Qing empire. There is a key, as
                        also found on the blue terrestrial maps, in the bottom
                        right corner, that provided the shapes associated with
                        each administrative unit (encoded toponyms). This map
                        demonstrates that during the early nineteenth century
                        the contents as shown on the blue terrestrial maps were
                        not unusual but part of a popular view of the Qing
                        empire. However, although conceptually and visually
                        similar to the blue maps, none of the 1818 maps survives
                        in as great numbers as the blue maps. The impressive
                        presentation of the blue maps likely made them the most
                        popular of this type at the time.

                  Since the Western Han Dynasty (206 BCE–9 CE) in China, data
                  sets of administrative information related to civil and
                  military affairs were collected, collated, and then made
                  manifest in
                  <span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">tu</span>. The Chinese term
                  <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">圖</span>
                  <span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">tu</span>
                  can translate into a number of different meanings like
                  diagram, picture, map, painting, and so forth, all related to
                  rendering three-dimensional space onto a two-dimensional
                  plane. Historically, local administrators, both civil and
                  military, were required to compile data sets and produce these
                  <span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">tu</span>. The
                  <span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">tu</span>
                  considered here are those most associated with cartography, as
                  they functioned as management tools for taxation, resource
                  allocation, agricultural planning, travel, military strategy,
                  and as symbols of ownership and authority. They often provided
                  information like population densities, geophysical
                  characteristics of place, types of buildings (religious,
                  civil, military), local resources, and so forth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These
                  <span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">tu</span>
                  typically lack a uniform or specific style of appearance but
                  were designed for instrumental purposes. In other words,
                  makers were less concerned with what the
                  <span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">tu</span>
                  looked like and focused on what they did and how they
                  functioned. For example, the
                  <span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">tu</span>
                  often do not have a uniform scale. Instead, toponyms or other
                  data are presented positionally or relationally between points
                  of reference (their positions relative to each other) and are
                  “encoded.” These administrative cartographic materials became
                  a distinctive Chinese typology that continued through the
                  millennia.

                  During the Qing dynasty the eighteen provinces (<span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">sheng</span>) were divided into circuits (<span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">dao</span>). The circuits were divided into prefectures (<span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">fu</span>), independent departments (<span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">zhilizhou</span>), and independent subprefectures (<span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">zhiliting</span>). The prefectures were divided into counties (<span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">xian</span>), departments (<span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">zhou</span>), and subprefectures (<span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">ting</span>). Thus, the blue terrestrial map provides a very accurate
                  and detailed breakdown of the administrative structure for the
                  entire empire in a single image.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A few of the geometric symbols on the blue Qing map are the
                  same shapes as those found in the Luo’s earlier Ming dynasty
                  atlas key. The difference being Luo placed the symbols by the
                  toponyms and the blue map imbeds the toponym in the shape.
                  These encoded toponyms, although using different visual
                  presentations, conceptually function in the same manner. The
                  use of geometric shapes in association with toponyms and
                  administration is a characteristic of a typology of Chinese
                  mapmaking that visually links places with the people of those
                  places. This encoding visually prioritizes administration over
                  territory, the people living in each administrative unit
                  become more important than depicting information according to
                  scale or geometry, as does the relational spacing of each
                  toponym with the surrounding ones in an administrative
                  hierarchy of the entire empire.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This manner of encoding toponyms is unique to Chinese
                  administrative maps. They reflect the human system
                  (administrative bodies like prefectures, sub-prefectures,
                  counties, and so forth) of all places in the empire
                  conceptually operating within a Chinese familial framework. If
                  we consider these encoded toponyms as presenting a
                  specifically Chinese paradigm of a socio-political order that
                  has a familial framework, then the entire atlas and
                  terrestrial blue map can be understood as presenting the
                  paradigm of an idealized order that is the Ming or Qing
                  empire. Within a specifically Chinese context this type of
                  socio-political order with a familial framework was first
                  proposed and implemented by Confucius (551–479 BCE) and his
                  followers as a method to promote peace and stability on micro
                  and macro scales. That is not to say that these maps are
                  explicitly Confucian in any way but that they present similar
                  paradigms. Confucianism, in its original formulation, before
                  it was assimilated with other religious and ritual practices,
                  is understood to be structured, on the micro-scale, as
                  relationships between individuals within a family then
                  applied, on the macro-scale, to relationships between
                  individuals and humanity and then scaled up to groups and the
                  larger world. A set of principles—including benevolence (<span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">ren</span>
                  <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">仁</span>),
                  righteousness (<span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">yi</span>
                  <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">義</span>),
                  propriety (<span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">li</span>
                  <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">禮</span>),&nbsp;wisdom (<span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">zhi</span>
                  <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">智</span>),
                  sincerity (<span class="inline-characters romanization-characters">xin</span>
                  <span class="inline-characters chinese-characters">信</span>)
                  and others—were created to maintain harmony and stability on
                  the micro and macro scales. Each toponym is encoded through a
                  shape that ties it immediately to the administration and a
                  social structure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The types of maps presented here visualize relationships
                  within a Chinese administrative order found between the
                  toponyms, geography, social structures, and the people that
                  inhabit those spaces. The micro-scale familial relationships
                  and social structure essential in understanding the
                  macro-scale frameworks of the Ming and Qing realm and its
                  mapping are valued and these maps precisely present the
                  hierarchy visually.
