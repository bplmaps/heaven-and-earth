                  In the early decades of nineteenth-century China, two series
                  of large-format maps, one terrestrial and one celestial, were
                  printed in the city of Suzhou. They were printed as eight
                  loose sheets using Prussian blue, the first large scale use of
                  this pigment in East Asia, in the unusual manner of a rubbing
                  from a stone-stele, resulting in most of the paper appearing
                  in bright blue. The terrestrial maps present the realm of the
                  Qing Empire (1644–1911) and selected surrounding regions. The
                  four extant editions of the celestial maps, dated to 1822 and
                  1826, present a planisphere of all the known stars and
                  extensive descriptions of known celestial bodies and their
                  related celestial mechanics. This exhibition considers these
                  two maps in the contexts of their production, consumption, and
                  functions revealing them as unique in the global history of
                  mapmaking.

                  In China, during the early decades of the nineteenth century,
                  two series<br>
                  of large format maps, one terrestrial and one celestial, were
                  printed<br>
                  between 1812 and 1826 in the city of Suzhou, one of the
                  economic and<br>
                  intellectual centers of the Chinese empire at the time and
                  throughout<br>
                  much of China’s imperial history. The terrestrial maps, of
                  which most of<br>
                  the ten editions are entitled <em>Geographical</em>
                  <em>Complete Map of the<br>

                  (1644–1911)<br>
                  and selected surrounding regions. The four extant editions of
                  the<br>
                  celestial maps entitled
                  <em>Complete Map of Unified Star Configurations in<br>

                  to 1822 and 1826, present a planisphere of all the known stars
                  and<br>

                  maps in<br>
                  the contexts of their interconnected “4 M’s;” that is
                  methods,<br>
                  materials, makers and models; while the catalogue entries
                  provide<br>

                  included in<br>

                <h2>Methods and Materials</h2>
                <p>
                  The methods and materials for the production and consumption
                  of the blue<br>
                  maps and charts are unique in cartographic history, not only
                  locally in<br>
                  East Asia but within the larger world.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-essay-fn1" id="page-essay-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  Both maps and charts were<br>
                  produced on eight sheets of Chinese <em>xuan</em> 宣 paper in
                  three unique<br>
                  manners; the paper, the printing method and the blue colorant.
                  While the<br>
                  associated mounting and consumption practices are also unique.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Xuan paper, made primarily in Anhui and Zhejiang provinces,
                  was<br>
                  principally blue sandalwood (Tara Wingceltis, L.
                  <em>Ulmus Cavaleriei</em>, C.<br>
                  <em>qingdan</em> 青檀), a deciduous tree found throughout
                  China, mixed with<br>
                  differing degrees of rice plant fibers. In the case of the
                  blue maps and<br>
                  charts, a low grade <em>xuan</em> type paper was used, one
                  with less blue<br>
                  sandalwood fibers and more rice plant fiber fill. The paper
                  used was<br>
                  unusual, between a low-cost bamboo paper typical of rubbings
                  (a printing<br>
                  technique) and a high-cost sandalwood paper typical of
                  painting and<br>
                  calligraphy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The blue maps follow closely the aesthetics of a print
                  production known<br>
                  as a rubbing. This printing production methodology began in
                  the Tang<br>
                  dynasty (618-907 CE). The manner of presentation of white
                  characters on<br>
                  a solid color, here blue, should be understood within the
                  context of<br>
                  historical Chinese practices associated with making rubbings
                  from stone<br>
                  stele and ancient bronzes. In China, rubbings were an
                  essential<br>
                  component of long-established epigraphic study and associated
                  collecting<br>
                  practices, as well as specific calligraphic practices. To make
                  a rubbing<br>
                  from an engraved stone stele, slightly moistened paper would
                  be fixed on<br>
                  a prepared, flattened smooth then carved, stone. The moist
                  paper would<br>
                  be manipulated using brushes and pointed sticks, pressing the
                  paper into<br>
                  the recessed areas of the carved stone. An inked (typically in
                  black)<br>
                  dauber (fabric over cotton wadding) would be tamped down onto
                  the<br>
                  paper-covered stone. The ink would adhere to the “raised”
                  paper making<br>
                  the areas of carved away stone appear in white. In this
                  process a<br>
                  positive image is carved on the stone, and a positive image is
                  created<br>
                  on the inked paper. This contrasts to the typical manner of
                  woodblock<br>
                  printing where a negative image is carved into the block, the
                  block is<br>
                  then inked and the paper pressed onto the inked block with the
                  ink<br>
                  transferring to the paper, making for a positive image on the
                  paper. In<br>
                  other words, typical woodblock printing creates a positive
                  image from a<br>
                  negative block.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The blue maps and charts production adhere this process of
                  making<br>
                  rubbings from stone steles, but through printing from
                  woodblocks instead<br>
                  of stone. Like a stone stele, a positive image would be carved
                  into a<br>
                  wooden block that was then used to print in the manner of a
                  rubbing.<br>
                  Historically in China, it is highly unusual to print from
                  woodblocks a<br>
                  positive image from a positive block, especially at this
                  scale.<br>
                  Woodblock printing typically was used to create more easily
                  and quickly<br>
                  multiple similar copies of any given work. Printing in the
                  manner of a<br>
                  rubbing is comparatively very labor intensive and time
                  consuming,<br>
                  creating essentially a unique print each time. Through close
                  visual<br>
                  analysis of the printed paper, the rubbing method of
                  production using<br>
                  woodblocks can easily be seen on the blue maps and charts. As
                  already<br>
                  noted, during the printing process the moistened paper was
                  pressed and<br>
                  stretched into the negative space of the carved woodblock,
                  furthest for<br>
                  the large characters of the title. After printing, when the
                  finished<br>
                  print was to be mounted, the paper was pressed flat and glued
                  to an<br>
                  additional paper backing. The resulting “stretch marks,”
                  formed during<br>
                  the printing process, became folds and creases that can be
                  easily seen<br>
                  when looked for closely on any copy of the blue maps or
                  charts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-essay-fn2" id="page-essay-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>

                  The most striking, and unusual, feature of these maps is of
                  course the<br>
                  blue color that sets them apart from other Chinese maps, and

                  of a celestial blue map by the Weissman Preservation Center at
                  Harvard<br>
                  University and Microtrace in Elgin Illinois, have confirmed
                  the pigment<br>
                  to be Prussian Blue. Prussian blue, a ferric (iron)
                  hexacyanoferrate,<br>
                  was first synthesized accidentally in Berlin by Johann Jacob
                  Diesbach, a<br>
                  Swiss painter and colormaker, in 1706. Its production is a
                  complex and<br>
                  time-consuming process of acidic additives into a
                  crystalline<br>
                  distillation with resulting varying sized crystals that can be
                  filtered<br>
                  to create different tones of blue (note the two tones of blue
                  used on<br>
                  the terrestrial map, see entry 3). The blue maps and charts
                  were<br>
                  produced around the time when Chinese manufacturers learned to
                  make the<br>
                  pigment locally and were less dependent on imports. The
                  discovery of the<br>
                  use of Prussian blue in the case of the blue maps and charts
                  is<br>
                  historically significant as it demonstrates the first
                  large-scale use of<br>
                  Prussian blue for printing in China, and East Asia, in the
                  first decades<br>
                  of the nineteenth century.

                  The blue maps and charts were popular, with ten editions (from
                  forty-six<br>
                  extant copies) for the terrestrial map and four editions (from
                  thirteen<br>
                  extent copies) of the celestial chart identified thus far.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-essay-fn3" id="page-essay-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  The<br>
                  consumption and display techniques of the blue maps and charts
                  hint to<br>
                  their popularity in Japan. The maps and charts were intended
                  to be<br>
                  mounted as sets of multiple (eight) hanging scrolls arranged
                  as a<br>
                  continuous image in a Chinese style known as the panoramic
                  screen<br>
                  (<em>tongjing ping</em> 通景屏), with no borders or gaps in
                  between the<br>
                  scrolls, and a one-color border (<em>yise biao</em> 一色裱) in
                  minimal<br>
                  proportions done in paper or brocade below and at the top of
                  each<br>
                  scroll. And, in general, when the printed sheets were mounted
                  in China<br>
                  this was the presentation style. The sheets however were also
                  sold and<br>
                  distributed as unmounted sheets.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-essay-fn4" id="page-essay-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  The maps and charts were soon<br>
                  popular in Japan and arrived as eight unmounted sheets. This
                  is<br>
                  evidenced by the numerous mounting styles fabricated in Japan.
                  The maps<br>
                  and charts can still be found mounted as hanging scrolls,
                  folded screens<br>
                  (<em>byōbu</em> 屏風, see entry 3), sliding doors (<em>fusuma</em>
                  襖), and folded<br>
                  sheet maps. The Japanese style mounting of the folded sheet
                  map has two<br>
                  covers, mounted on the back of the map in opposite corners of
                  the map<br>
                  proper, that protect the map when folded. In the case of the
                  hanging<br>
                  scroll style (original Chinese style) in Japan, a two-color
                  mount style<br>
                  (<em>erse biao</em> 二色裱, and different from the Chinese
                  style) using two<br>
                  separate border colors was used, the preferred style in
                  Japan.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-essay-fn5" id="page-essay-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  The<br>
                  number of still extent blue maps and charts mounted in
                  Japanese styles<br>
                  attests to their popularity in Japan.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Confirmation that the maps were intended to be mounted as
                  hanging<br>
                  scrolls, can be found in the title slips extant on many prints
                  of the<br>
                  terrestrial maps (see entry 3). These title slips were
                  printed<br>
                  vertically and stacked on the far-right exterior edge of the
                  first sheet<br>
                  for most editions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-essay-fn6" id="page-essay-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  The map’s title, in an abbreviated form (<em>Da Qing<br>
                    yitong dili quantu</em>), is repeated eight times in individual rectangular<br>
                  framed boxes. In addition, these eight title slips are
                  numbered in the<br>
                  bottom right corner of each slip, from top to bottom, one to
                  eight.<br>
                  Typically, title slips were a small blank sheet of paper added
                  during<br>
                  the mounting process to the exterior of the rolled hanging
                  scroll<br>
                  (hanging scrolls are rolled when stored). After application to
                  the<br>
                  scroll by the mount maker a title would be written on the
                  slip. In other<br>
                  words, the title slips were typically produced by the mount
                  maker,<br>
                  entirely separately from the printing process, and attached to
                  the<br>
                  scroll when the work was mounted onto the backing paper that
                  helps<br>
                  protect the original work. On the blue maps, however, these
                  title slips<br>
                  were incorporated into the original printing process, even
                  though they<br>
                  were not, technically, part of the map proper. It is quite
                  unusual that<br>
                  title slips were part of the original printed work, to be
                  removed by the<br>
                  mount maker. Mount makers would typically never alter the
                  original work<br>
                  in any way. The title slips imply that the printer and mount
                  maker,<br>
                  typically unrelated craftsmen, collaborated, or at least that
                  the<br>
                  production team seriously considered the mount maker as part
                  of the<br>
                  project. The intentional inclusion of these eight slips
                  indicates that<br>
                  the maps were to be mounted as hanging scrolls, with the title
                  slips cut<br>
                  off, separated and placed outside the mount as labels on the
                  exterior of<br>
                  the rolled scrolls; again a highly unusual production model.
                  What is<br>
                  interesting to note is that the printed sheets were
                  distributed to Japan<br>
                  as loose sheets, where mounters kept the title slips attached
                  when<br>
                  mounting the maps (see entry 3). As demonstrated above, the
                  production<br>
                  of the blue maps and charts are unusual in historical
                  (Chinese, East<br>
                  Asian and World) mapmaking through using a low-grade Xuan
                  paper and<br>
                  unique in three ways, rubbing printing method, title slips,
                  and in use<br>
                  of Prussian blue.

                  Suzhou, one of the economic and intellectual centers of the
                  Qing empire<br>
                  at the time of the blue maps and charts production and
                  throughout much<br>
                  of China’s imperial history, appears on all signed editions,
                  of thus far<br>
                  unidentified persons and or their studios, of the terrestrial
                  map as a<br>
                  place of production. Only the last edition of the blue
                  celestial chart<br>
                  dated to the fifth month of 1826 is signed by a known
                  personage, Qian<br>
                  Yong (1759–1844). Qian Yong was a poet and author as well as
                  an<br>
                  accomplished calligrapher of the so-called stone stele (<em>bei</em>
                  碑) school<br>
                  of calligraphy, traveling extensively throughout China
                  collecting<br>
                  samples of rubbings from stone stele. That a calligrapher was
                  part of<br>
                  the design of the blue celestial maps should come as no
                  surprise. All<br>
                  celestial editions can be divided by calligraphic types into
                  three<br>
                  different styles, unusual for a single object. The first
                  section is<br>
                  dedicated to the large eight-character title in seal script
                  (<em>zhuanshu</em><br>
                  篆書), while the last section contains an inscription in
                  clerical script<br>
                  (<em>lishu</em> 隸書), giving some general information about
                  the chart, which<br>
                  differs between the 1822 and the 1826 editions. The main text
                  written in<br>
                  standard script (<em>kaishu</em> 楷書) on six sheets, is
                  structured along<br>
                  sixteen section heads demarcated by white boxes with blue
                  character<br>
                  titles. That the celestial map was designed with multiple
                  styles of<br>
                  calligraphy suggests a calligrapher, like Qian Yong, designed
                  the text<br>
                  layout and that he participated in the creation of all four
                  editions.

                  In late imperial China, the collecting, making of rubbings and
                  copying<br>
                  of calligraphy found on ancient stone stele (<em>bei</em>),
                  and the rubbings of<br>
                  calligraphy on ancient bronze vessels or from copy books of
                  calligraphy<br>
                  (<em>tie</em> 帖) schools of calligraphy were both popular.
                  These two schools<br>
                  of collecting and related collecting practices originated in
                  the<br>
                  seventeenth century amongst groups of scholars, artists,
                  collectors, and<br>
                  calligraphers that formed social groups around literary,
                  collecting, and<br>
                  artistic practices of common interest, often sharing and
                  collaborating<br>
                  with each other.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-essay-fn7" id="page-essay-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  These types of scholarly groups were in a period of<br>
                  revival in the early nineteenth century with well-known<br>
                  scholar/painter/calligrapher/rubbings collectors including Yi
                  Bingshou<br>
                  伊秉綬 (1755–1815) who wrote sixteen quatrain poems on famous
                  model<br>
                  rubbings. Qian Yong was likely active in similar groups and
                  discussions<br>
                  among such groups which probably contributed to the creation
                  of the blue<br>
                  maps and charts. No doubt the proximity to the two 1247 map
                  steles, the<br>
                  <em>Dili tu</em> and <em>tianwen tu</em> (see entries 1 and
                  2), themselves in the<br>
                  Confucian temple in Suzhou also helps explain Qian Yong’s
                  interest in<br>
                  the blue map and chart project, as he was an avid stele-school
                  follower<br>
                  himself.

                  Luo Hongxian’s (1504-64)
                  <em>Enlarged Territorial Atlas</em> (<em>Guangyu tu</em>,
                  see<br>
                  catalogue entry 5) dated 1566, includes maps of the eighteen
                  provinces<br>
                  of late Ming dynasty (1368-1644) China. Luo created
                  twenty-four<br>
                  standardized symbols, found in a key, associated with census
                  figures,<br>
                  military information and tributary reports and placed them
                  next to place<br>
                  names, in the earliest use in China of an “encoded toponym.”
                  The use of<br>
                  geometric shapes in association with toponyms and
                  administration is a<br>
                  characteristic of a typology of Chinese mapmaking that
                  visually links<br>
                  places with the people of those places beginning in the late
                  Ming<br>
                  dynasty. The blue terrestrial maps use a key and a
                  conceptually similar<br>
                  system, except the toponyms were placed inside the encoded
                  shapes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By encoding administrative units with a geographic shape and
                  thus<br>
                  visually prioritizing administration over geography, the
                  people living<br>
                  in each administrative unit become important, as does the
                  relationship<br>
                  of each toponym with the surrounding ones in an administrative
                  hierarchy<br>
                  of the entire empire (by mapping placenames that are
                  presented<br>
                  relationally as opposed to geometrically/to scale to each
                  other). Each<br>
                  toponym is encoded through a shape that ties it immediately to
                  the<br>
                  administration and a social structure. If we consider these
                  encoded<br>
                  toponyms as presenting a specifically Chinese paradigm of a<br>
                  socio-political order that has a familial framework, then the
                  entire<br>
                  terrestrial blue map can be understood as presenting the
                  paradigm of an<br>
                  idealized order that is the Qing empire. Within a specifically
                  Chinese<br>
                  context this type of socio-political order with a familial
                  framework was<br>
                  proposed and implemented by Confucius (551-479 BCE) and his
                  followers as<br>
                  a method to promote peace and stability on micro and macro
                  scales. That<br>
                  is not to say that these maps are explicitly Confucian in any
                  way but<br>
                  that the blue terrestrial maps present similar paradigms.
                  These maps<br>
                  visualize the correlative relationships of a Chinese
                  cosmological order<br>
                  found between the toponyms, geography, social structures, and
                  the people<br>
                  that inhabit those spaces. The micro-scale familial
                  relationships and<br>
                  social structure essential in understanding the macro-scale
                  frameworks<br>
                  of the Qing realm and its mapping are valued and these maps
                  precisely<br>
                  present the hierarchy visually.

                <h2>Huang family legacy</h2>
                <p>
                  In the preface of the blue terrestrial map the authors credit
                  as their<br>
                  principal source Huang Qianren’s (黃千人 1694–1771)), a
                  student at the<br>
                  National University and later a low-ranking official, 1767 map
                  titled<br>
                  <em>Complete map of the everlasting Great Qing unified all
                    under heaven</em><br>
                  (<em>Da Qing wannian yitong tianxia quantu)</em>. Huang in
                  turn, on his 1767<br>
                  map, credits his grandfather’s, Huang Zongxi 黃宗羲
                  (1610–1695), map of<br>
                  the early Qing empire (<em>Yudi quantu)</em> dated to 1673.
                  The general layout<br>
                  and administrative emphasis, in particular the use of encoded
                  toponyms,<br>
                  of the blue terrestrial maps thus lay in the legacy of the
                  Huang<br>
                  family’s map making.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Two other maps in the exhibition claim the same lineage to the
                  Huang<br>
                  family. The large lower map of Ma Junliang’s (jinshi 1761)
                  <em>Capital<br>
                    Edition of the complete map (based on) astronomy</em>
                  (<em>Jingban tianwen<br>
                    quantu</em>
                  京板天文全圖), from circa 1795, also claims to be based on
                  Huang<br>
                  Qianren’s 1767 map (see catalogue entry 6). And Zhu Xiling’s
                  <em>Complete<br>
                    all under heaven map of the everlasting unified Qing
                    empire</em>
                  (<em>Daqing<br>
                    yitong tianxia quantu</em>
                  大清一統天下全圖), dated to 1818, follows the<br>
                  same lineage (see catalogue entry 7).
                </p>
                <h2>Cosmological/astrological Pairing</h2>
                <p>
                  The terrestrial maps conceptually and visually prioritize
                  multiple<br>
                  “inner” and “outer” historical administrative frameworks
                  that<br>
                  participate in Chinese familial practices set within a
                  standardized<br>
                  infrastructure of geophysical and manmade attributes (see
                  entry 3). The<br>
                  celestial charts present a planisphere of stars and
                  constellations in<br>
                  conjunction with geographic and planetary correlations while
                  surrounding<br>
                  texts present important celestial mechanics (see entry 4).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although the two maps can function separately, and each emerge
                  from<br>
                  their own unique historical trajectories they should be
                  understood<br>
                  conceptually as part of a larger cosmological framework.
                  Modern analytic<br>
                  examinations typically ignore the combination of celestial
                  and<br>
                  terrestrial mapping, preferring to polarize and separate the
                  two map<br>
                  types (the terrestrial is considered geographic and historical
                  while the<br>
                  celestial is scientific). This exhibition and related
                  catalogue<br>
                  rectifies this trend. These maps were meant to be considered
                  together in<br>
                  relationships and correlations participating in a long
                  historical<br>
                  tradition established since at least the stone steles
                  <em>Dili tu</em><br>
                  (<em>Geographical Map</em>) and the <em>Tianwen tu</em>
                  <em>(Celestial Chart</em>) carved in<br>
                  1247 (See catalogue entries 1 and 2). This is confirmed in the
                  epilogue<br>
                  of the 1822 edition of the celestial chart where both of the
                  1247 map<br>
                  and chart are specifically cited. The titles of the blue map
                  and chart<br>
                  provide further confirmation. First, the terrestrial map
                  specifically<br>
                  used the term <em>dili</em> (terrestrial) in the title at a
                  time when the<br>
                  preference was to use the term <em>tianxia</em> (all under
                  heaven, see entry<br>
                  7).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-essay-fn8" id="page-essay-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  And second, both titles use the binomial terms <em>yitong</em><br>
                  (unified) and <em>quantu</em> (complete map or chart) as a
                  connecting linkage.<br>
                  While the use of these binomial terms is not unusual for the
                  terrestrial<br>
                  map they are highly unusual for a celestial chart confirming
                  the two<br>
                  terms are meant to connect and couple the blue map and chart
                  and thus to<br>
                  function in the same manner as the 1247 map and chart.
                  Conceptually<br>
                  functioning like the thirteenth century steles, the blue maps
                  (although<br>
                  greatly expanded, updated, and differing completely in
                  their<br>
                  materiality) show the territory and administrative structure
                  of Qing<br>
                  China with some surrounding regions as combined with a
                  planisphere of<br>
                  all the known stars. As a result, the subtle and covert
                  political<br>
                  implications (see entry 1) found on the combined 1247 map and
                  chart<br>
                  presented by ethnically Han officials longing for an earlier
                  (and thus<br>
                  idealized) Han Chinese based political structure are
                  reactivated (in a<br>
                  <em>gujin</em> paradigm, see entry 6), in an equally subtle
                  and covert manner,<br>
                  through the blue maps and charts during the early nineteenth
                  century by<br>
                  ethnically Han scholars in Suzhou (not the capital of Beijing)
                  longing<br>
                  for a time and political structure from before Manchu rule.

                  The blue maps and charts follow closely the aesthetics of a
                  print production method known as a rubbing. To make a rubbing
                  from an engraved stone stele, slightly moistened paper would
                  be fixed on a prepared, flattened smooth then carved, stone.
                  The moist paper would be manipulated using brushes and pointed
                  sticks, pressing the paper into the recessed areas of the
                  carved stone. An inked (typically in black) dauber (fabric
                  over cotton wadding) would be tamped down onto the
                  paper-covered stone. The ink would adhere to the “raised”
                  paper making the areas of carved away stone appear in white.
                  In this process a positive image is carved on the stone, and a
                  positive image is created on the inked paper. The “rubbings”
                  that are the blue maps and charts were however made using
                  woodblocks. They contrast to the typical manner of woodblock
                  printing where a negative image is carved into the block, the
                  block is then inked and the paper pressed onto the inked block
                  with the ink transferring to the paper, making for a positive
                  image on the paper. Printing using the rubbing method is
                  comparatively very labor intensive and time consuming,
                  creating essentially a unique print each time. Historically in
                  China, it is highly unusual to print a rubbing from
                  woodblocks, creating a positive image from a positive block,
                  especially at the scale of the blue maps and charts.

                  Two schools of collecting and related collecting practices
                  originated in seventeenth century China amongst groups of
                  scholars, artists, collectors, and calligraphers that formed
                  specialized social groups. The first group collected, made
                  rubbings and copied calligraphy found on ancient stone stele
                  (bei 碑), while the second group did the same for calligraphy
                  found on ancient bronze vessels or from copy books of
                  calligraphy (tie 帖). Both types of scholarly groups were in a
                  period of revival in the early nineteenth century and Qian
                  Yong (one confirmed author of the blue charts) was likely
                  active in such groups which contributed to using the rubbing
                  production method for the blue maps and charts.

                  The most striking, and unusual, feature of the maps and charts
                  is the blue color. It sets them apart from other Chinese maps,
                  and indeed maps from any other part of the world, produced at
                  the time. Scientific spectral analysis, first done at the
                  Weissman Preservation Center at Harvard University, has
                  confirmed the pigment to be Prussian Blue.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Prussian blue, a ferric (iron) hexacyanoferrate, was first
                  synthesized accidentally in Berlin by Johann Jacob Diesbach, a
                  Swiss painter and colormaker, in 1706. Its production is a
                  complex and time-consuming process of acidic additives into a
                  crystalline distillation with resulting varying sized crystals
                  that can be filtered to create different tones of blue (note
                  the two tones of blue used on the terrestrial map).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The blue maps and charts were produced around the time when
                  Chinese manufacturers learned to make the pigment locally and
                  were less dependent on European imports. The discovery of the
                  use of Prussian blue in the case of the blue maps and charts
                  is historically significant as it demonstrates the first
                  large-scale use of Prussian blue for printing in China, and
                  East Asia, in the first decades of the nineteenth century.

                  The blue star chart presents three different types of
                  calligraphy. The first (far right) sheet presents the
                  eight-character title in seal script (zhuanshu 篆書), the last
                  (far left) sheet presents an epilogue, a date and a signature
                  of the maker in clerical script (lishu 隸書), while the
                  remaining six sheets present celestial information using
                  standard script (kaishu 楷書). That a single object presents
                  three distinctive styles of calligraphy is highly unusual in
                  Chinese visual arts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The final sheet of the 1826 star chart is signed by Qian Yong
                  (1759–1844), a poet and author. Qian was as an accomplished
                  calligrapher and collector of rubbing of the so-called stone
                  stele (bei 碑) school of calligraphy, traveling extensively
                  around China collecting samples of rubbings from stele. That
                  the celestial chart was designed with multiple styles of
                  calligraphy suggests a calligrapher, like Qian Yong, designed
                  the text layout. Also, that the production of all the maps and
                  charts are done in the manner of rubbings suggests a collector
                  of rubbings. And finally, that the two stele that the blue map
                  and chart are modeled after were, and still are, found in the
                  city of Suzhou and the blue maps and charts were all produced
                  in the city of Suzhou suggests that Qian Yong participated in
                  all phases of production.

                  The blue terrestrial map and two other maps in this exhibition
                  specifically cite the work of the Huang family of Qing court
                  cartographers as models for their maps. The Huang family
                  lineage began with Huang Zongxi (1610-95) and his 1673
                  Complete Map of China (Yudi quantu), a map modeled from Luo
                  Hongxian’s 1555 Complete Terrestrial Map (Yudi zongtu).
                  Huang’s map was amended and updated by his grandson Huang
                  Qianren (1694–1771) as a multi-colored woodblock-printed map
                  in 1767 with the title All under heaven map of the everlasting
                  unified Qing empire (Daqing wannian yitong tianxia quantu). It
                  is the 1767 map that is referenced for all three maps.

                  A particular characteristic of the Chinese typology of
                  administrative map first introduced by Luo Hongxian’s
                  (1504-64) in his Enlarged Territorial Atlas (Guangyu tu) of
                  the mid sixteenth century, was toponyms that were encoded to
                  reflect the humanity (administrative bodies like prefectures,
                  sub-prefectures, counties, and so forth) of all places in the
                  empire operating within a Chinese familial framework.

                  Administrative unit types, identified in a key, linked
                  geometric shapes to toponyms, visually linking places with the
                  people of those places. This encoding visually prioritizes
                  administration over territory, the people living in each
                  administrative unit become more important than scale or
                  geometry, as does the relational spacing of each toponym with
                  the surrounding ones in an administrative hierarchy of the
                  entire empire.

                  Ma Junliang’s Capital Edition of the complete map (based on)
                  astronomy, of circa 1795, presents visually the Chinese
                  concept of gujin 古今. Gujin means something like “past and
                  present.” The character gu means an unspecified there-then and
                  jin means the here-now. The two terms knit
                  together—gujin—suggest a conversation between temporalities,
                  whereby Chinese scholars actively joined historical events of
                  the past to help define the present moment through a process
                  of deliberate recovery and application. Conceptually the gujin
                  paradigm is also found in the blue maps and charts that
                  specifically model and reference the 1247 map and chart to
                  define the moment of their creation.

                  Correlative properties on the blue chart and the tianwen tu
                  can be found on the outer ring (horizon). It is read
                  counterclockwise and indicates numerous directional signifiers
                  such as the widths of the twenty-eight lunar mansions (the
                  constellations that the moon “appears in” over the course of
                  its cycle), the twelve terrestrial branches (chen 辰), twelve
                  Jupiter stations or zodiacal positions (muxingci 木星次),
                  names of the ancient states (fen 分) and ancient divisions (ye
                  野) of China “governed” by that group of stars. For example,
                  the “first” section reads “zi (at the bottom of the blue
                  chart, offset right and the top of the tianwen tu, offset
                  left) is in the yuanxiao position (ci), ancient state (fen) of
                  Qi, Qingzhou division (ye, today’s Shandong province).”

                  There is an accepted and understood relational co-existence
                  and correlation between events observed in the sky and events
                  on earth, a type of astrological consideration found in many
                  cultures from ancient times until today. The example above
                  confirms that conceptually there is a direct correlation
                  between the celestial and terrestrial realms with spatial
                  coordinates for both presented side by side in the same
                  pie-section division.

                  The epilogue of the 1822 edition of the blue celestial chart
                  specifically references Huang Shang’s dili tu and tianwen tu.
                  Huang’s two maps were meant to be combined to present ideal
                  models for the young Prince Jia, the future Ningzong Emperor
                  (r. 1194-1224) on good governance. The map displays a unified
                  China before the creation of the Southern Song dynasty
                  (1127-1279), a period before the Song imperial family lost
                  north China to the Jurchen-led Jin Dynasty (1115-1234), as an
                  aspiration to return to the earlier idealized time of the
                  Northern Song dynasty. When combined with the star chart, the
                  viewer was meant to visualize that good governance through the
                  correlative properties between heaven and earth found on the
                  micro scale within both the map and chart and on the macro
                  scale in consideration of the entire empire. Huang’s map and
                  chart were a deliberate piece of statecraft meant to serve as
                  a moralistic exemplar for the young Ningzong emperor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over 500 years after the creation of Huang’s map and chart,
                  Chinese scholars in the city of Suzhou decided to create their
                  own, albeit in blue, updated images of heaven and earth. As a
                  result, the subtle and covert political implications found in
                  the combined 1190s map and chart presented by ethnically Han
                  officials longing for an earlier (and thus idealized) Han
                  Chinese based political structure are reactivated (in a gujin
                  paradigm), in an equally subtle and covert manner, through the
                  blue maps and charts during the early nineteenth century by
                  ethnically Han scholars in Suzhou (not the capital of Beijing)
                  longing for a time and political structure from before Manchu
                  rule.

                        The blue maps and charts reference and were inspired by
                        a pair of maps engraved on steles located, then and
                        still today, in the Confucian Temple (Wenmiao 文廟) in
                        the city of Suzhou as confirmed in the epilogue of the
                        1822 blue celestial chart. One of them is a terrestrial
                        map titled Dili tu 墬理圖 (Geographical map) and the
                        other a celestial chart titled Tianwen tu 天文圖. The
                        scholar Huang Shang 黃裳 (1146–1194), active in the
                        Southern Song (1126–1279) court, created both these maps
                        in the 1190s, and subsequently Wang Zhiyuan 王致远
                        (1193–1257) had them engraved on stone in 1247 and since
                        that time rubbings on paper have been made of these
                        maps. Huang’s two maps were first meant to be combined
                        to present ideal cosmological models for the young
                        Prince Jia, the future Ningzong 寧宗 Emperor (r.
                        1194-1224) on good governance. The viewer was meant to
                        visualize that good governance through the correlative
                        properties between heaven and earth found on the micro
                        scale within each of the two maps and on the macro scale
                        in consideration of the entire empire with the two maps
                        combined. Over 600 years after the creation of the
                        steles, Chinese scholars in the city of Suzhou decided
                        to create their own, albeit in blue, updated images of
                        heaven and earth so closely linked to their own city.

                        The dili tu illustrates 368 prefectures, 623 military
                        bases, 73 rivers, 27 lakes, 180 mountains and 24 passes.
                        The year that Huang Shang presented this map to the
                        court, the Guangzong Emperor (r. 1190-94) abdicated the
                        throne to his younger brother the Ningzong Emperor (r.
                        1194-1224). The map displays a unified China before the
                        creation of the Southern Song dynasty (1127-1279), a
                        period before the Song imperial family lost north China
                        to the Jurchen-led Jin Dynasty, as an aspiration to a
                        return to the earlier idealized time of the Northern
                        Song dynasty. The dili tu was a deliberate piece of
                        statecraft meant to serve as a moralistic exemplar of
                        the hoped for outcome of good government for the young
                        Ningzong emperor.

                        curved course of the Milky Way is clearly demarcated.
                        Keep in mind that the grouping and naming of groups of
                        stars in China differs from more familiar Greco-Roman
                        constellation names. The&nbsp;*tianwen tu&nbsp;*uses a traditional
                        Chinese equatorial-polar projection. There are three
                        “rings” required to plot the relative positions of
                        celestial bodies, the horizon (outer circle), the
                        (celestial) equator (offset circle) and the ecliptic
                        (apparent path of the sun against the stars, other
                        offset circle). The inner circle is the line of constant
                        visibility (constellations like the Big Dipper [known as
                        the Seven Stars or Northern Plow in Chinese], always in
                        the night sky in the northern hemisphere, can be found

                        The epilogue of the 1822 edition of the blue celestial
                        chart specifically references the 1247
                        <em>dili tu</em> and <em>tianwen tu</em> as models of
                        emulation for the blue maps and charts confirming the
                        source. The main text body of the
                        <em>tianwen tu</em> discusses all important celestial
                        bodies and their configurations (dimensions and shapes),
                        relative movements, cycles and durations, relationships
                        to terrestrial phenomenon (like the four seasons),
                        irregular occurrences (eclipses or supernovas), and how
                        the fortunes of any terrestrial place can be understood

                      <p>
                        In the planispere of the <em>tianwen tu</em>, each
                        constellation is named, the curved course of the Milky
                        Way is clearly demarcated and although the text states
                        there are 1565 stars only 1440 stars are shown (fig.
                        ).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-catalogue-2-fn1" id="page-catalogue-2-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                        There are three “circles” or “rings” (<em>dai</em> 带)
                        required to plot the relative positions of celestial
                        bodies, the horizon, the (celestial) equator and the
                        ecliptic (apparent path of the sun against the stars).
                        The <em>tianwen tu</em> uses a traditional Chinese
                        equatorial-polar projection, the inner circle is the
                        line of constant visibility, the equator (<em>chidao</em>
                        赤道, literally “red road”) is shown as an offset circle
                        within the planisphere while the ecliptic (<em>huangdao</em>
                        黃道) is the other offset circle intersecting it also
                        within the planisphere, both are labeled as such. The
                        radial lines from the center demarcate the twenty-eight
                        lunar mansions (<em>xiu</em> 宿), each labeled by a
                        character with a ring around it.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-catalogue-2-fn2" id="page-catalogue-2-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                        And the hour circles of the determinative star of each
                        lunar mansion radiates here as straight lines.

                      <p>
                        Correlative properties, like those found on the blue
                        chart and astral allocation (<em>fenye</em>) charts in
                        general, can be found on the outer ring of the
                        <em>tianwen tu</em>. The outer ring (horizon) of the
                        <em>tianwen tu</em> is read counterclockwise and
                        indicates numerous directional signifiers such as the
                        widths of the twenty-eight lunar mansions, the twelve
                        terrestrial branches (<em>chen</em> 辰), twelve Jupiter
                        stations or zodiacal positions (<em>muxingci</em>
                        木星次), names of the ancient states (<em>fen</em> 分)
                        and ancient divisions (<em>ye</em> 野) of China, the
                        later as determined by Yu the Great, that was “governed”
                        by that group of stars. For example, as also found on
                        the blue charts, the section with the “first” branch
                        (<em>chen</em>) <em>zi</em> (at the top of the chart,
                        offset left), is “in the <em>yuanxiao</em> position
                        (<em>ci</em>), ancient state (<em>fen</em>) of Qi,
                        <em>Qingzhou</em> division (<em>ye</em>, today’s
                        Shandong province, fig. ).”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-catalogue-2-fn3" id="page-catalogue-2-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>

                      <p>
                        This type of astrological consideration is found in many
                        cultures from ancient times until today. The example
                        from the <em>tianwen tu</em> confirms that conceptually
                        there is understood to be a direct correlation between
                        the celestial and terrestrial with, localized or grouped
                        according to each lunar mansion as found on the outer
                        ring, spatial coordinates for both presented side by
                        side in the same pie-section division. There is an
                        accepted and understood relational co-existence and
                        correlation between events observed in the sky and
                        events on earth.

                        of the Yellow River is the band of white “desert dots”
                        of the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts; and wave patterned
                        oceans of the Atlantic (top left) to the Pacific (half
                        of panel two on the right).&nbsp;There are two prominent
                        man-made structures; The Great Wall, with its
                        distinctive crenelated wall pattern, which runs between
                        the Yellow River and the Gobi Desert; and the Willow
                        Palisade, which emerges close to where the Great Wall
                        ends and enters the sea, is demarcated by cross-hatched
                        lines.

                        This is an administrative map of the Qing empire with
                        encoded toponyms (the key is in the large bottom right
                        text box) marking the inner sphere of the eighteen
                        provinces of “China proper” and the outer sphere made up
                        of&nbsp;a surrounding ring of text blocks, with no borders of
                        any kind, associated with non-Qing political entities
                        that have official relations, and geographic proximity,
                        with the Qing empire,&nbsp;including Russia, India, Thailand,

                        visually and easily enables a snapshot of the entire

                        Qing empire.

                        Several Geophysical attributes can be easily
                        distinguished in the overall visual presentation of this
                        map of the Qing empire; such as the two vivid white
                        lines of the Yellow River (north) and the Yangzi River
                        (south) which divide the empire east and west. Just
                        north of the Yellow River is the band of white “desert
                        dots” of the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts running from
                        the third to the eighth panel. Surrounding much of the
                        empire is the wave patterned oceans from the Atlantic
                        (top left) to the Pacific (half of panel two on the
                        right) and seas. There are two prominent man-made
                        structures as well. The Great Wall, with its distinctive
                        crenelated wall pattern, which runs between the Yellow
                        River and the Gobi Desert. The other manmade structure
                        shown is the lesser-known Willow Palisade (<em>liutiaobian</em>
                        柳條邊), which emerges close to where the Great Wall
                        ends and enters the sea and is demarcated by
                        cross-hatched lines. The Willow Palisade is the symbolic
                        barrier protecting the Manchu homeland within which are
                        located the Manchu imperial tombs, the “eastern capital”
                        東京 or “secondary capital,” Shengjing 盛京 (m. Mukden)
                        and the Imperial hunting grounds.

                      <p>
                        The typology of this map is administrative using
                        specifically the device of an encoded toponym first used
                        in Luo Hongxian’s <em>Guang yutu</em> (see entry 5) for
                        a type of map unique to East Asia. The majority of the
                        eight sheets is taken up by displaying the
                        administrative structure of the Qing empire into an
                        inner and an outer sphere, although the exact boundaries
                        between these two spheres are intentionally ambiguous.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The inner sphere is made up of the eighteen provinces of
                        “China proper” and is populated with encoded toponyms
                        (fig.) linking placenames to administrative unit types
                        (prefectures, sub-prefectures, counties, and so forth)
                        that are identified in the key found in the preface at
                        the bottom right (fig.). The use of geometric shapes in
                        association with toponyms and administration visually
                        links places with the people of those places. By
                        encoding administrative units with a geographic shape
                        and thus visually prioritizing administration over
                        territory, the people living in each administrative unit
                        become important, as does the relation of each toponym
                        with the surrounding ones in an administrative hierarchy
                        of the entire empire. The administrative coding visually
                        and easily enables a snapshot of the entire
                        administrative, communications, and tax systems.

                      <p>
                        While the inner portion of the maps focuses on the
                        administrative framework of the Qing empire by
                        presenting encoded toponyms, the outer sphere is made up
                        of a surrounding ring of text blocks (labeled fig.),
                        with no borders of any kind, associated with states that
                        have official relations, and geographic proximity, with
                        the Qing empire and are described on the map as places
                        that “bring tribute” (<em>chaogong</em>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-catalogue-3-fn1" id="page-catalogue-3-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                        These include a range of non-Qing entities, including
                        Russia, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, and Korea, as
                        visually unbounded spaces. These outer entities, as text
                        blocks, also require administrative attention, albeit
                        from separate governmental agencies. The outer sphere
                        entities were generally governed by ranked local
                        administrators in specific cities that reported to the
                        Ministry of Rites and included Annam (today’s Vietnam),
                        Burma (today’s Myanmar), the Ryukyu (Okinawa) Islands,
                        and Siam (today’s Thailand). Russia (fig.), also
                        presented as part of this outer sphere, was administered
                        by the Board for Governing Outer Territories (ch.
                        Lifanyuan 理藩院; manch.
                        <em>Tulergi golo be darasa jurgan</em>). Only Joseon
                        Korea (fig.) was given special privilege, communicating
                        with no intermediary body but directly with the Ministry
                        of Rites in Beijing.

                      <p>
                        The maps also present an ambiguous third sphere, between
                        the inner and outer. This in-between sphere is made up
                        of the regions conquered and integrated into the Qing
                        empire in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries:
                        Mongolia, Tibet, Xinjiang, and Taiwan. On the blue maps,
                        these regions include both administrative units encoded
                        by shape as well as short annotations similar to those
                        for the non-Qing regions, taking on elements from both
                        the inner and outer spheres.

                      <p>
                        Geographical and topographical elements like oceans,
                        mountains and rivers are embedded throughout the entire
                        map, linking the inner, outer, and in-between spheres in
                        a grand vision of Qing space. Frontiers were not sites
                        of separation but sites of relationality acting as
                        bridges connecting people, things and ideas. By using
                        toponyms that were encoded to reflect the humanity
                        (administrative bodies) of all places in the empire
                        operating within a Chinese familial framework, this type
                        of map presents, visually, systems for maintaining all
                        the empire’s relationships, internal and external or
                        inner and outer. It can be understood to conceptually
                        manifest an idealized and harmonious empire that
                        emphasized an historically stable core of eighteen

                        The main text body on the 1826 editions of the blue
                        charts essentially copies the text of the 1247 Tianwen
                        tu rubbing. On the planisphere, however, each named
                        constellation is updated with additional stars
                        discovered by Europeans (since the discovery of the
                        telescope) and introduced into Chinese star charts by
                        other Europeans working in the Chinese court from the
                        seventeenth century onwards. The curved course of the
                        Milky Way (labeled as <em>tianhe</em>, “heavenly river”)
                        is clearly demarcated.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The outer ring (horizon) of the blue charts directly
                        connects the celestial realm with the terrestrial one.
                        It reads counterclockwise (in the manner of the rotation
                        of the night sky to an observer on earth) and indicates
                        numerous directional signifiers. For example, the
                        section at the bottom of the chart with the “first”
                        branch zi 子 (north), is in the <em>yuanxiao</em> 元枵
                        position, corresponding to the ancient state of Qi 齊
                        and Qingzhou province 青州 (today’s Shandong province),
                        clearly indicating that specific sets of constellations
                        are tied to the ancient twelve provinces of China. This
                        horizon band provides astrological cues and emphasizes
                        the intended functionality of correlations and
                        correspondences between heaven and earth that are to be
                        interpreted by man.

                        The blue
                        <em>Huntian yitong xingxiang quantu</em> (Complete chart
                        of unified star configurations in the heavens) are star
                        charts with related celestial information. The first
                        (far right) sheet presents the title in seal script
                        while the last (far left) sheet presents an epilogue, a
                        date and a signature of the maker in clerical script.
                        The remaining six sheets present a planisphere and
                        related celestial information using standard script.

                        The main text body on the 1826 editions of the blue
                        charts essentially copies the text of the 1247
                        <em>Tianwen tu</em> stele (see entry 2). The sections
                        are clearly indicated by headings, presenting the
                        Chinese characters in blue on white, while the primary
                        text is white on a blue field; the same aesthetic found
                        on the terrestrial maps.

                      <p>
                        The central and most eye-catching part of this chart is
                        the planisphere. On it, each constellation is named and
                        the curved course of the Milky Way (labeled as Tianhe
                        天河, “heavenly river”) is clearly demarcated.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-catalogue-4-fn1" id="page-catalogue-4-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                        The outer ring (horizon) of the blue charts provides
                        pointers to understanding the night sky and even more
                        directly connects the celestial realm with the
                        terrestrial one. It reads counterclockwise (in the
                        manner of the rotation of the night sky to an observer
                        on earth) and indicates numerous directional signifiers,
                        as also found on the 1247 <em>Tianwen tu</em>. The chart
                        is printed in such a way that the characters always face
                        outward. When the planisphere is “rotated” (conceptually
                        as the physical object is too large) to the time of
                        observation the characters at the “bottom” are always
                        right side up and in a position to be easily read. They
                        are rather technical and require an astronomical and
                        astrological knowledge base. The directional signifiers
                        include the relative widths of the twenty-eight lunar
                        mansions, the twelve terrestrial branches (<em>chen</em>
                        辰), twelve Jupiter positions or zodiacal positions (<em>ci</em>
                        次), and the corresponding states and provinces under
                        the astral allocation system (<em>fenye</em> 分野, also
                        known as field-allocation). This division into twelve
                        parts under the astral allocation system had been in
                        astrological use since the late fifth century BCE and
                        correlates celestial and terrestrial space.

                      <p>
                        For example, the section at the bottom of the chart with
                        the “first” branch <em>zi</em> 子 (north), is in the
                        <em>yuanxiao</em> 元枵 position, corresponding to the
                        ancient state of Qi 齊 and Qingzhou province 青州
                        (today’s Shandong province, see entry 2). This horizon
                        band of the blue charts provides astrological cues and
                        emphasizes the intended functionality of correlations
                        and correspondences between heaven and earth that are to
                        be interpreted by man. The blue charts, like the
                        <em>Tianwen tu</em>, clearly indicate that specific sets
                        of constellations are tied to the ancient twelve
                        provinces of China. A direct correlation between heaven
                        and earth is thus embedded into the chart itself. This
                        conceptual consideration can be further applied to the
                        overall framing of the combined two blue map and chart,
                        which are created as a pair, terrestrial and celestial,
                        and modeled on the 1247 <em>dili tu</em> and
                        <em>tianwen tu</em>, maintaining the correlative
                        properties between heaven and earth, within a Chinese
                        cultural sphere.

                        The final sheet (missing on the Adler copy) has an
                        epilogue that simply states the purpose of the map: To
                        explain heavenly bodies. It is dated May 1826 (sixth
                        year of Daoguang reign, fourth month
                        道光六年歲在丙戊孟夏之月) and signed by Qian Yong from
                        Jingui&nbsp;金匱梅溪钱泳書. Of all the ten editions of the
                        terrestrial map and the four editions of the celestial
                        map this is the final and only edition that has a
                        signature of a known maker for the blue maps and charts.
                        Qian Yong was a poet and author as well as an
                        accomplished calligrapher of the so-called stone stele
                        (<em>bei</em> 碑) school of calligraphy, traveling
                        extensively around China collecting samples of rubbings
                        from stele. That the celestial chart was designed with
                        multiple styles of calligraphy suggests a calligrapher,
                        like Qian Yong, designed the text layout and that he
                        participated in the creation of all four editions.&nbsp;That
                        the production of all the maps and charts are done in
                        the manner of rubbings suggests a collector of rubbings
                        suggested this method. And that the two stele that the
                        blue map and chart are modeled after were, and still
                        are, found in the city of Suzhou and the blue maps and
                        charts were all produced in the city of Suzhou suggests
                        that Qian Yong participated in all phases of production.

                        mid-sixteenth century. Luo Hongxian (1504-64) in his
                        well-known&nbsp;<em>Guang yutu</em>&nbsp;(<em>Expansive terrestrial atlas</em>) created the earliest atlas in China that was first
                        printed in circa 1555. This slightly later edition,
                        dated to 1566, has forty-six maps within the atlas. The
                        first map, the&nbsp;<em>Complete terrestrial map</em>&nbsp;(<em>Yudi zongtu</em>),&nbsp;became a model for Qing map makers and was the
                        foundation for the Huang family maps and eventually the
                        blue terrestrial maps.

                        administrative bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;That information, in Luo’s
                        atlas, was converted into&nbsp;twenty-four standardized
                        symbols found in a key, the earliest use of an “encoded
                        toponym.”&nbsp;Instead of encircling the toponyms with the
                        shape as on the blue maps, the&nbsp;<em>Guang yutu</em>&nbsp;shows
                        the symbols in red next to the names as can be seen in
                        the&nbsp;<em>Map of Zhejiang Province</em>&nbsp;(<em>Zhejiang yutu</em>). The atlas visually enabled an easy understanding of
                        administrative and military divisions along with avenues
                        of communication.&nbsp;The integration of text and image as
                        seen here, where a shape was correlated with a place
                        name that was only generally in a relational location is
                        a cartographic typology that is unique to East Asian
                        maps.

                        This slightly later edition, dated to 1566, has
                        forty-six maps within the atlas, each with a grid called
                        a <em>jili huafeng</em> 計里畫方, its own scale and a
                        descriptive preface. The first map, the
                        <em>Complete terrestrial map</em> (<em>Yudi zongtu</em>), became a model for Qing map makers and was the
                        foundation for the Huang family maps (see essay, entries
                        3, 6 and 7) and eventually the blue terrestrial map,
                        although it does not include, notably, the great wall.

                        In the Ming and Qing dynasties, administrators were
                        responsible for supplying statistics about their
                        administrative bodies. Based on census figures, military
                        information and tributary reports Luo Hongxian created
                        his atlas. That information, in Luo’s atlas, was
                        converted into twenty-four standardized symbols that are
                        found in a key, the earliest use of an “encoded
                        toponym.” Luo used different geometric shapes in
                        combination with accompanying text to provide
                        information that included administrative systems,
                        residences and land taxes, garrisons and troop numbers,
                        and roads.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        While the grid is absent from the blue maps and only
                        alluded to in the introduction, keying administrative
                        units to specific shapes can be found both on the
                        <em>Guang yutu</em> and the blue maps. Luo Hongxian’s
                        prototype presented the shapes and toponyms differently
                        than on the blue maps: Instead of encircling the
                        toponyms with the shape, the <em>Guang yutu</em> shows
                        the symbols next to the names as can be seen in the
                        <em>Map of Zhejiang Province</em> (<em>Zhejiang yutu</em>, fig.).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The encoded toponyms present the micro-scale Ming or
                        Qing Chinese familial relationships and social structure
                        essential in understanding the macro-scale frameworks of
                        the Ming or Qing Chinese realm and its mapping as valued
                        by the state, presenting the hierarchy visually. The
                        atlas visually presented the tax base and therefore
                        income of the state and enabled an easy understanding of
                        administrative and military divisions along with avenues
                        of communication. The integration of text and image as
                        seen here, where a shape was correlated with a place
                        name that was only generally in a relational location is

                              In European-style maps, a place name and any
                              administrative indicator are typically next to
                              each other and separated. The distinction where
                              European cartography tended to polarize
                              subjectivity and objectivity while East Asian
                              cartography united it, is well demonstrated in
                              this map. In addition, scientific and geometric
                              “accuracy” was not an important factor in the
                              making of these maps. And the administrative
                              accuracy is higher than anything achieved in
                              European maps of the period.

                        Ma Junliang was an official cartographer working in the
                        imperial court in Beijing in the late eighteenth
                        century. Here, Ma juxtaposes three different maps
                        created during two different historical periods. The
                        small map at the top right is the&nbsp;<em>Complete geographic map of mountains and streams</em>&nbsp;<em>(Shanhai yudi quantu</em>), from Wang Qi’s
                        (1529-1612),&nbsp;illustrated&nbsp;<em>Sancai tuhui</em>&nbsp;encyclopedia of 1609.&nbsp;&nbsp;The map in the top left is the
                        “eastern hemisphere” map from Chen Lunjiong’s (fl.
                        1703-1730)&nbsp;<em>Record of things heard and seen in the maritime
                          countries</em>&nbsp;(<em>Haiguo wenjian lu</em>), completed in 1730 and
                        first printed in 1744. Chen’s simple
                        schematic&nbsp;terraqueous&nbsp;map is however a direct
                        descendent, albeit only showing the eastern hemisphere,
                        of Zhang Hong’s&nbsp;(1527-1608)&nbsp;<em>Complete geographical map of mountains and
                          streams</em>&nbsp;(<em>Yudi shanhai quantu</em>) published in his&nbsp;<em>Compilation of illustrations and writings</em>&nbsp;(*Tushu bian)&nbsp;*encyclopedia of 1613.&nbsp;The two small
                        maps at the top (the past&nbsp;<em>gu</em>&nbsp;of
                        the&nbsp;<em>gujin</em>&nbsp;paradigm) represent late Ming period
                        mapmaking presentation practices created when European
                        notions of world geography were first introduced.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The&nbsp;<em>jin</em>&nbsp;of the paradigm is represented by the
                        large map below, a version of the Huang family map as a
                        contemporary Chinese map of the Qing empire. European
                        mapping practices introduced in the early seventeenth
                        century, were again in the 1790s being introduced when a
                        European presence was pressing again in the Chinese
                        court. The three maps together, two from the late Ming
                        that were being revisited, are juxtaposed with a
                        contemporary map at a time when Qing China like late
                        Ming China was coming to terms with a largely unknown
                        and potentially threatening world.

                      <p>
                        Ma Junliang (imperial graduate degree [<em>jinshi</em>]
                        1761) was an official cartographer working for the
                        imperial court in Beijing in the late eighteenth
                        century. Ma created the woodblock printed
                        <em>Capital edition of the complete map [based on]
                          astronomy</em>
                        (<em>Jingban tianwen quantu</em>) during the mid-1790s.
                        This colored copy is unusual in that most extant copies
                        are simply black ink on paper.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-catalogue-6-fn1" id="page-catalogue-6-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                        This map was created at a time when cartographers in
                        China, like Ma and Zhuang Tingfu (1728-1800), were
                        reexamining historical mapping practices.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-catalogue-6-fn2" id="page-catalogue-6-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                        They both participate in a type of mapmaking that
                        involves using the <em>gujin</em> paradigm. The binomial
                        term, <em>gujin</em> 古今 means something like “past and
                        present” and is made up of the character
                        <em>gu</em> meaning an unspecified there-then and
                        <em>jin</em> meaning the here-now. The two terms knit
                        together—<em>gujin</em>—suggest a conversation between
                        temporalities, whereby Chinese scholars actively joined
                        historical events of the past to help define the present
                        through a process of deliberate recovery and
                        application.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-catalogue-6-fn3" id="page-catalogue-6-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                        Conceptually this paradigm is also found in the blue
                        maps and charts that specifically model and reference
                        the 1247 map and chart.

                        Here, Ma Junliang juxtaposes three different maps
                        created during two different historical periods. The
                        small map at the top right is the
                        <em>Complete geographic map of mountains and streams</em>
                        <em>(Shanhai yudi quantu</em>), from Wang Qi’s
                        (1529-1612), illustrated
                        <em>Sancai tuhui</em> encyclopedia of 1609. The map in
                        the top left is the “eastern hemisphere” map from Chen
                        Lunjiong’s (fl. 1703-1730)&nbsp;<em>Record of things heard and seen in the maritime
                          countries</em>
                        (<em>Haiguo wenjian lu</em>), completed in 1730 and
                        first printed in 1744.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-catalogue-6-fn4" id="page-catalogue-6-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                        Chen’s simple schematic terraqueous map is however a
                        direct descendent, albeit only showing the eastern
                        hemisphere, of Zhang Hong’s (1527-1608)
                        <em>Complete geographical map of mountains and
                          streams</em>
                        (<em>Yudi shanhai quantu</em>) published in his
                        <em>Compilation of illustrations and writings</em> (<em>Tushu bian)</em>
                        encyclopedia of 1613. The two small maps at the top (the
                        past <em>gu</em> of the <em>gujin</em> paradigm)
                        represent late Ming period mapmaking presentation
                        practices created when European notions of world
                        geography were first introduced.

                      <p>
                        The <em>jin</em> of the paradigm is represented by the
                        large map below. It belongs to the Huang family lineage
                        of Qing court map makers and derives from Huang Zongxi’s
                        (1610-95) 1673 <em>Map of China</em> (<em>Yudi quantu</em>), amended by his grandson Huang Qianren (1694–1771) in
                        1767 (see entries essay, entries 3 and 7).
                        <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-catalogue-6-fn5" id="page-catalogue-6-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                        The date is important, for just a few years before, in
                        1759, Manchuria, Mongolia, Tibet, and Chinese Turkistan
                        were finally brought under Qing rule. Emperor Qianlong
                        (r. 1736-96) appointed officials from the Manchu
                        administrative units called banners, as well as local
                        political figures, to supply statistics about their
                        administrative districts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-catalogue-6-fn6" id="page-catalogue-6-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                        That information was compiled by Huang Qianren and
                        published as a multi-colored woodblock-printed map in
                        1767 with the title
                        <em>All under heaven map of the everlasting unified Qing
                          empire</em>
                        (<em>Daqing wannian yitong tianxia quantu</em>), the
                        same map that was a source for the blue terrestrial map.
                        Ma presents his version of the Huang family map on the
                        <em>Jingban tianwen quantu</em> as a contemporary
                        Chinese map of the Qing empire. Ma’s map connected the
                        “then and now” visually, looking to the past to find
                        accessible historical maps that matched and helped
                        explain the changed circumstances of the present.
                        European mapping practices introduced in the early
                        seventeenth century, were again in the 1790s being
                        introduced when a European presence was pressing again
                        in the Chinese court. The three maps together, two from
                        the late Ming that were being revisited, are juxtaposed
                        with an indigenous Chinese map at a time when Qing China
                        was coming to terms with a largely unknown and
                        potentially threatening world.

                      <p>
                        Zhu Xiling&nbsp;printed at least three editions of this
                        map,&nbsp;all as multi-colored woodblock prints dated to
                        1818.&nbsp;Like the blue terrestrial map, this map is
                        based&nbsp;Huang Qianren’s map of 1767&nbsp;crediting Huang
                        Zongxi, Qianren’s grandfather, as his ultimate source.
                        This map, like the blue terrestrial map, emphasized the
                        administration of the Qing empire. There is a key, as
                        also found on the blue terrestrial maps, in the bottom
                        right corner, that provided the shapes associated with
                        each administrative unit (encoded toponyms).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In comparison to the blue terrestrial map Zhu’s map
                        differs in several interesting points. The most obvious
                        is the scale. Zhu Xiling compresses vertically the same
                        “space” into a tall thin map while the blue maps expand
                        the width to almost three times that of the 1818 map.
                        The next obvious difference is in coloration. All extent
                        prints of Zhu’s map use multiple colors, in the 18
                        provinces of “China proper” and natural elements like
                        the oceans, deserts, and mountains. Below&nbsp;the title, are
                        lists of distances from each province to the capital
                        andthis map presents the capital Beijing as much larger
                        and more detailed, including a depiction of the
                        forbidden city, with all gates labeled on the inner and
                        outer sections of the capital.

                        Zhu Xiling (act. early 19th c.) printed at least three
                        editions of his
                        <em>All under heaven complete map of the unified Great
                          Qing (Da Qing yitong tianxia quantu)</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-catalogue-7-fn1" id="page-catalogue-7-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                        They are all multi-colored woodblock printed maps dated
                        to 1818. Like the blue terrestrial map, this map is
                        based Huang Qianren’s
                        <em>All under heaven complete map of the everlasting
                          unified Great Qing</em>
                        (<em>Daqing wannian yitong tianxia quantu</em>) of 1767
                        crediting Huang Zongxi, Qianren’s grandfather, as his
                        ultimate source.

                        In comparison to the blue terrestrial map Zhu’s map
                        differs in several interesting points. The most obvious
                        is the scale. Zhu Xiling compresses vertically the same
                        “space” into a tall thin map while the blue maps expand
                        the width to almost three times that of the 1818 map.
                        The next obvious difference is in coloration. All extent
                        prints of Zhu’s map use multiple colors, primarily in
                        the 18 provinces of “China proper” and the region
                        surrounded by the Willow Palisade. Natural elements like
                        the oceans, deserts, and mountains are colored as well.
                        The use of multiple colors, like printing a map all in
                        blue, makes for a striking presentation visually
                        enhancing each map.

                      <p>
                        Below the title, are lists of distances from each
                        province to the capital (absent on the blue terrestrial
                        maps). Furthermore, the 1818 map presents the capital,
                        Beijing as much larger and more detailed, including a
                        depiction of the forbidden city, with all gates labeled
                        on the inner and outer sections of the capital (fig. ).

                        This map, like the blue terrestrial map, emphasized the
                        administration of the Qing empire. There is a key, as
                        also found on the blue terrestrial maps, in the bottom
                        right corner, that provided the shapes associated with
                        each administrative unit (encoded toponyms). This map
                        demonstrates that during the early nineteenth century
                        the contents as shown on the blue terrestrial maps were
                        not unusual but part of a popular view of the Qing
                        empire. However, although conceptually and visually
                        similar to the blue maps, none of the 1818 maps survives
                        in as great numbers as the blue maps. The impressive
                        presentation of the blue maps likely made them the most
                        popular of this type at the time.
